<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p>It is hoped that this book will serve as a reminder to all D
Company men and their descendants of the serious and frivolous,
sad and happy moments of an experience which alone could be
obtained in a great conflict. From the time of the first call to
service to the final muster-out of the Company, theirs were the
thrills of the silent secrecy of war-time movements, the glorious
reception at home when the task was completed, the joy of
seeing their comrades honored, the sorrow at their loss, and for
those who remain, the satisfaction of knowing they accomplished
the end toward which they were turned when the declaration
of war against Germany was proclaimed.</p>

<p>To the nobility of sacrifice shown by all those who remain in
the hallowed fields of France this work is dedicated, as well as to
that of the one who was singled out as a concrete example of
the best D Company could produce. Not the smallest measure
of honor is taken from the names of Rogers, Parmalee, Kennedy,
Kapitzke, Butler, Callahan, Donth, McAviney, Meickle, Wickwire,
Rosenkind and Wilfore by selecting that of their commander,
for in him lived the same spirit which guided them,
and their memory will last as long as free men battle for the
right and champion the cause of justice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="small">BEFORE THE WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>From the dash and romance of cavalry to the plodding
machine-gunner of the Great War, from the gilt-bedecked uniforms
of a parade organization to the grim olive drab of the
American army, and from citizen soldiery who took drilling
once each week as a recreation, to mud-spattered, cootie-infested
veterans, was the path of evolution followed by Troop "A,"
Cavalry, Connecticut National Guard. It was brought into
existence by act of the General Assembly of Connecticut on the
second Thursday of October, 1808, which authorized the
formation of a company of cavalry to be known as the "Second
Company of the Governor's Horse Guards ... to attend
upon and escort him in times of peace and war," and by accepting
this obligation and supplying its own equipment and uniforms
to be exempted "from every other kind of military duty."</p>

<p>As a social organization, the Company continued to enlist the
élite of New Haven and the surrounding towns for nearly a
hundred years, appearing in parades as escort for distinguished
visitors and vieing with similar organizations in Connecticut and
neighboring states in making the social seasons a round of gayety
for its members and friends. During its early history, while
the seat of the state government was located in New Haven, the
occasions were numerous when it was called upon to perform
its chosen duty of parading. However, with the advent of the
day when men who formerly had fine saddle horses were provided
with automobiles, and with the shifting of the state capitol to
Hartford, interest in the Horse Guards relaxed slightly, and it
was unkindly remarked by envious infantrymen that the mounts
used by the Company had become so accustomed to making their
daily rounds with the milk wagons they attempted to stop at
familiar houses along the route of march.</p>

<p>An amendment to the original charter was passed by the General
Assembly in 1861, increasing the strength of the Company
from sixty to one hundred and twenty enlisted men, with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
major, one captain, four lieutenants, eight sergeants and eight
corporals completing the roster of officers and non-commissioned
officers where there had been but one captain, two lieutenants,
three sergeants and four corporals under the first charter.</p>

<p>While the company of Horse Guards took no active part as
a unit in the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War
and the Spanish-American War, men from the organization had
left the Company to take important parts in all four conflicts.</p>

<p>A second amendment to the charter, approved June 17, 1901,
provided that upon application "either or both companies of the
Governor's Horse Guards" could be organized as a troop of
cavalry in the Connecticut National Guard with a personnel of
"one captain, one first lieutenant, one second lieutenant, one first
sergeant, one quartermaster sergeant, six sergeants, six corporals,
two farriers, one saddler, two trumpeters and not more
than forty nor less than thirty-five privates." Seeing in this
act an opportunity to become a military unit, the organization
promptly presented a petition, and an order was issued by
Adjutant General Cole July 5, 1901, authorizing the immediate
formation of the troop, to be designated as Troop "A," Connecticut
National Guard. This was followed by the election
of Luzerne C. Ludington to the office of captain of the Troop.
William J. Bradnack was chosen first lieutenant and Robert J.
Woodruff second lieutenant, with John Hugo first sergeant and
the following members:&mdash;</p>

<p>Shortly after receiving recognition as a militia unit, the Troop
was called together and it was decided that the Second Regiment
armory on Meadow Street was unfitted for cavalry drill, so a
committee was appointed to obtain a site for a new armory.
Generous contributions on the part of prominent citizens enabled
the erection of a wooden structure on the lot at 839 Orange
Street. This building was barely completed when, in January
1905, it was burned to the ground.</p>

<p>Undaunted by this reverse, it was immediately decided to
rebuild, and plans were made to put up a fire-proof structure.
Once more men interested in the success of the Troop aided the
building project by purchasing bonds, and the armory as it now
stands was opened with appropriate ceremony in the Spring of
1906.</p>

<p>When the State bought the armory from the Troop it was
suggested to men who held bonds covering the indebtedness on
the building that the Troop should own a certain number of
horses. Release from the payment of many obligations allowed
the purchase of twenty horses in the Fall of 1909, and these
were installed in the stables in the rear of the armory.</p>

<p>Funds to furnish the club rooms and pay interest on the
building bonds were obtained through the willingness of the
men to turn into the treasury the pay they received for the time
spent in camp each year with the other militia units. These
were added to from time to time by receipts from very popular
and successful horse shows held in the winters of 1907, 1908,
1909 and 1910. These shows attracted exhibits from the best
known fanciers in the East, and were famed as society events.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Features of these shows were the crack drill exhibitions given
by squads selected from the Troop's best riders. A military
tournament, which included all competition that could be
arranged for mounted men, followed when horse shows reached
the point of exclusiveness they attained as the automobile came
into common use.</p>

<p>During this period the men were being perfected in field work
by road marches and manœuvers. In many of these they were
placed under the command of regular army officers and rode
beside troopers from the regular army, with due credit to their
militia training.</p>

<p>In 1909 Sergeant Harry Denton was detailed by the War
Department to instruct the Troop in the arts of war. The
coming of this excellent soldier marked the advent of a new
era for the unit. Riding classes were organized for ladies and
large squads turned out every week for "monkey drill." Monkey
drill taught the men the rudiments of trick riding and many of
them became very well versed in handling their mounts and
themselves in the difficult manœuvers. One of the best squads
developed in the Troop included George Condren and John
Paton, who later commanded the Company in France, Frank E.
Wolf, who led the Company to its training area on the other
side, George Wallace and Harold W. Herrick, who were commissioned
officers during the great War, and others who were
prominent in home activities during the period of hostilities.</p>

<p>Always ready for any action, the Troop was not called upon
to aid the State authorities until June 4, 1911, when rioting in
Middletown by striking employees of the Russell Brothers' mills
resulted in a call received at the Troop armory at 1:30 in the
afternoon on that date. The first platoon, comprised of two
officers and thirty-two men, was loaded on a special train and
arrived on the scene of the trouble three hours later, fully
equipped and ready for any eventuality. However, the presence
of the Troop and the businesslike deportment of the men proved
sufficient to prevent further outbreaks, and after four days of
duty the Troopers were ordered home.</p>

<p>For nearly nine years the original officers remained on the
active roster. In 1910 Second Lieutenant Robert J. Woodruff
found it necessary to resign because of his duties in the courts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
and Frank E. Wolf was chosen by the men to take his place.
The retirement of First Lieutenant William J. Bradnack three
years later caused the advancement of Lieutenant Wolf to that
rank and then to captain in 1915, when Captain Luzerne C.
Ludington left the service after more than thirty years as an
officer in the old Horse Guards and the Troop.</p>

        <span class="xsmall">REMEMBER YOUR FIRST MOUNTED DRILL AT THE ARMORY?</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>When Lieutenant Wolf became captain, his junior officers
were First Lieutenant F. T. Maroney and Second Lieutenant
William H. Welch. It was these three men who headed the
remodeled Troop which left Niantic, Conn., their summer
manœuvering grounds, for the Mexican border on June 29, 1916,
when National Guard units of the different states were answering
the call to mobilization in order to quell the vicious raids
being made upon American lives and property along the Mexican
border line.</p>

<p>Sergeant Harry Homers, who had relieved Sergeant Denton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
as instructor to the Troop and afterward obtained his discharge
from the regular army to enter business, was one of the men to
appear for enlistment when word was sent out that a number
were needed to bring the Troop up to its war strength of one
hundred and five men. Men on reserve were called back, and
within four days Sergeant Condren, in charge of the recruiting,
announced that no more were needed. Called out June 19, the
Troop remained at the Armory until June 25, when extra men
and equipment were loaded onto a special train and sent to the
state camp at Niantic, while those with riding experience rode
the Troop mounts overland.</p>

<p>Physical examinations in camp reduced the number of men on
the roster, but the required strength was ready for muster into
the federal service and the subsequent trip to Nogales, Arizona.
Troop trains carrying horses move slowly, and nine days passed
before the men detrained at the little border town in the far
southwest. The intense heat of the sun in that climate proved
trying for men accustomed to the climate of the seacoast, so
within a few weeks numerous discharges were granted following
persistent examinations by the medical department.</p>

<p>Camped at the top of a hill not far from Nogales, the majority
of the men had their first experience in soldiering and considered
the treatment they received in the light of hardship until they
looked back on this trip as a picnic from the battlefields of
Europe. Here they learned to ride, shoot, mount guard and do
kitchen police according to the steel-bound regulations of the
army. They learned something of the value and meaning of
discipline, learned how to care for themselves and their horses,
and for the first time, as soldiers, carried loaded ammunition in
their belts when they walked guard in the streets of the little
border town, always in sight of the squalid, sneaky-looking
Mexican sentries just across that narrow strip of neutral territory
on the boundary line.</p>

<p>New horses were issued by the government so that each man
had a mount to care for and call his own, and when, during the
latter part of August, the Troop was called upon to take part in
manœuvers, they rode like veterans, drawing commendation for
both officers and men.</p>

<p>One of the most serious blows to the morale of the organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
was felt by the Troop not long after it reached Nogales.
The carefully selected cook, who enlisted for the tour of duty,
proved better at handling cards than he did at conjuring food
out of army rations. Instructor Sergeant Arthur J. Fisher,
assigned to the Troop a couple of years previously when Sergeant
Homers left the army, stepped into the breach, however,
and gave the men the benefit of his years of experience in regular
army kitchens. Under his direction Arthur Parmalee and
Francis Foley gained expert knowledge and the Troop kitchen
became as efficient as any in the district.</p>

<p>Assigned to relieve a troop of the regular cavalry doing patrol
duty near the custom house at Lochiel, twenty-eight miles east
of Nogales, the Troop spent a month there patrolling and perfecting
the prescribed drills. The surroundings of the new camp
were ideal for out-door life and the twenty miles that intervened
between the men and the nearest army post tended to foster
organization spirit. Card games, letter writing and rides over
the hills occupied the spare time the men found on their hands
at rare intervals. It was only the persistent rumors and chilly
nights which came with fall weather that made the men anxious
to leave for home.</p>

<p>There being no further necessity of maintaining such a large
force of men at the border, the Troop was named as one of the
units to start the homeward trip. Returning to Nogales September
30, Troop A occupied, as barracks, mess halls of the
type they had built when they first arrived. There they worked
on the problems of turning over horses and equipment to the
authorities, only thirty-two horses and equipment for that number
being allotted to the Troop by the War Department, and
entrained, bound for home, October 10.</p>

<p>A long trip through the mountainous section of the southwest
and the prairie region of the west with only short daily
stops to water and feed the horses, found the Troopers willing to
take the first chance that offered to relieve the monotony of the
journey. When the train stopped at Kansas City for a short
time many of the men visited the city. Supplies were purchased
from the Troop fund to add to the issued rations of corned beef
hash and beans and the train pulled out with a happy crowd of
soldiers.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>Mysterious bottles made their appearance from under coats
and inside shirts to add their share to the celebration. There
was no sleep in the Pullmans that night. Making friends with
the guard at the door of the kitchen car was easy, for he was
Irish and inclined to be friendly, so a case of fresh eggs was
soon in the hands of the men nearest the door. These they used
with great abandon to the discomfort of the porter and members
of the guard. The next morning omelets were dripping from
the lighting fixtures and walls and formed a thick film over hats
and shoes exposed to the attack. The violent character of the
barrage prevented investigation during the battle and when the
affair had quieted down it was judged by First Sergeant Herrick
that the entire car-load was at fault so all were pressed into
service to police the car.</p>

<p>The rest of the trip home was long and tedious. Innumerable
delays were experienced, for, with the emergency at an end, the
railroads shifted troop trains aside at the least excuse. The
journey was brightened, however, by a trip to Niagara Falls for
the men who took advantage of a stop at Buffalo. New Haven
people lined the streets in an unprecedented outpouring of welcome
when the train pulled into the home station October 22.</p>

<p>Parades followed during the next week, with a city banquet
for all returned men, and the Troop was mustered out of the
federal service, November 4, 1916, after four months experience
in the field. Early the following week the members of the
organization were fêted by the hustling organization of Troop
A veterans and prominent New Haven men paid tribute to the
spirit the unit had shown in its first attempt at regular soldiering.</p>

<p>The winter which followed was filled with preparation for
eventualities. The shadow of war spreading irresistibly from
the European battlefields grew more ominous over the country
until unrestricted submarine warfare brought to a focus the
indignities the United States had suffered from Germany since
the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>. After the declaration of war April
6, 1917, an order was issued causing four troops of cavalry to
be formed, from the two then in existence in the State, to make
up the Third Separate Squadron of Militia Cavalry.</p>

<p>The nucleus for M Troop, formed in New Haven, was taken
from among the non-commissioned officers and privates of Troop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
A. Lieutenant William H. Welch, who had been made first
lieutenant upon the resignation of Lieutenant Maroney, became
captain of the new troop. First Sergeant Herrick was made
first lieutenant and Stable Sergeant George M. Wallace was
advanced to the rank of second lieutenant. This change resulted
in the appointment of Sergeant George D. Condren as first lieutenant
of Troop A and Supply Sergeant John A. Paton was
commissioned second lieutenant.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="small">MOBILIZATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Activity preparatory to the mobilization of national guard units
began with Troop A early in April when the usual weekly drill
was augmented by an extra session later in the week for the
non-commissioned officers and ambitious privates who cared to
attend. Hikes on Saturday afternoons and several trips to
Montgomery's farm in Mt. Carmel were added to the training.
This program was filled with interest by the proclamation of
President Wilson in May calling all militiamen in the northeastern
department into active service on July 25th. Then a
period was given over to equipping the men and forming them
into units of correct proportions during which there were endless
amounts of paper-work to be handled and a large percentage of
recruits to be trained.</p>

<p>As the 26th Division never saw a concentration camp, this
early training was of such a nature as to physically fit the men
for active duty, but at no time tended to increase their knowledge
of the particular work they were to do. On responding
to the call to report at the Troop A armory in Orange Street on
the morning of July 25th the men found that their soldierly
duties lay largely in packing equipment to be shipped to camp, a
little kitchen police and cleaning out the armory. Considered
as necessary evils, these tasks were cared for with good will.
However, the departure of Lieutenant Condren with thirty-one
men and the Troop's complement of horses on July 27 for
Niantic was an appreciated move in the direction of desired activity,
and the following day the remainder of the organization
experienced the varied emotions of a leave-taking on the Green
with Mayor Campner on hand to bid them good-bye in the name
of the city, and a cheering crowd lining the streets to the station.</p>

<p>Soft muscles felt the strain of unloading the freight from the
special train which bore the unit to Niantic, and with the camp
erected, the kitchen operating and a guard posted, the rigors of
the first night in camp for many of the men were softened by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
slumber which soon overcame any objection men from offices
and factories might have taken to sleeping on cots long since
past the stage of usefulness.</p>

<p>In the meantime the men under the command of Lieutenant
Condren had arrived at camp, put up picket lines and cared for
their horses. They had made the march from New Haven to
Niantic by easy stages and had been extensively fêted in the
village of Westbrook by one of the residents who had befriended
the Troop on former occasions. Thus field conditions obtained
for the first time for the new Troop A.</p>

<p>Sunday in camp was its usual delight with visitors from home
and Monday was given over to perfecting the camp arrangements.
Other units on the state reservation were Troops B, L
and M, forming with Troop A the 3d Separate Squadron of
Connecticut Cavalry, Troop A, Signal Corps, the 1st Ambulance
Company, the Field Hospital, the 1st Separate Company (Infantry),
and batteries E and F, 10th Field Artillery, all units of the
Connecticut militia. All were placed under the command of
Lieutenant Colonel Shuttleworth, U. S. A., for training and
organization.</p>

<p>The following week both mounted and dismounted drills were
inaugurated and camp routine began with a formal guard mount
on July 31, the first few attempts at this ceremony affording
great amusement for all except those participating. Social lions
in the ranks of the Company were establishing themselves in the
hearts of the fair inhabitants of Pine Grove and carrying off the
honors at the dance pavilion and under the energetic leadership
of Sergeant Rogers a baseball team was being formed. In short,
camp was being established with all the formalities attendant
upon such an event.</p>

<p>On Saturday, August 3, all organizations were mustered into
the Federal service by Lieutenant Colonel Shuttleworth. Thus
the men were made soldiers of the United States Army, permitting
the War Department to use the various militia units for
duty outside the borders of Connecticut. Governor Marcus B.
Holcomb reviewed the Squadron on the afternoon of August 7
in its first and last appearance before him as cavalry.</p>

<p>Baseball was taking its proper place on the schedule with
games arranged for Saturdays, Sundays and Wednesdays, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Troop A fared not so well on the diamond in competition with
the rest of the Battalion as it did later on the football field. The
proper spirit to win games was never lacking, but talent was
scarce until the recruiting drive of the latter part of the month
brought several good players into the Company.</p>

<p>Summer's hottest and most sultry days were passed at Niantic
with the minimum of discomfort because of the location of the
camp almost on the shores of Long Island Sound, where breezes
from the water tempered the efforts of the sun down to a point
where comfort was possible and the proximity of bathing facilities
allowed the men relief after drills.</p>

<p>Evidences of preparation for a prolonged stay and perhaps
a lack of knowledge concerning the conditions in store for them
created a certain restlessness among the men, whose hearts were
all centered on the hope of getting to France.</p>

<p>Endeavors of the ladies of Niantic to promote community
spirit and provide the men with the proper kinds of entertainment
were ably seconded by Troop members, who were always
well represented at social events and took a leading part in contributing
excellent talent for all sorts of entertainments. From
Scheffler's singing and Culver's type of vaudeville to Parmalee
and Hine as boxers, there was an almost endless amount of
artistic ability.</p>

<p>In preparation for the journey the men were to take, talks
were delivered on hygiene and kindred topics by members of
the medical department; and a Red Cross worker who had seen
service with the French armies related some of his experiences
to crowds which grasped each word with the avidity of a youngster
listening to his first tales of achievement. The "Front" was
a great mystery and one who had actually seen parts of that ever-changing
line of opposing armies was looked up to as an individual
upon whom the gods of fortune had smiled.</p>

<p>Another effect of this feeling of impending movements which
was growing among the men was an increased desire to take
advantage of the proximity to their homes, and many were the
exits and entries through the fence while the unsuspecting guard
"walking his post in a military manner" was going, according to
schedule, in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Falling as a mixed blessing came the announcement on August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
15 that the horses were to be taken from the Troop and the personnel
used in the formation of a machine gun company. To
the new men in the ranks it was a relief, but to those who were
with the outfit when it enjoyed that happy little picnic on the
Mexican Border during the summer of 1916 it meant the loss of
their most valued friends. They wasted no time in mourning,
however, but gathered up all the available information on
machine-gun work and set their minds to become proficient in
that branch of the service with the cheerful prospect of becoming
members in what the British army called the "suicide club."</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="small">PREPARATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The last two weeks of August produced revolutionary changes
in the old Troop, recruits were eagerly sought to fill out the
ranks of the organization from its cavalry strength of one hundred
and five men to the machine-gun requirements of one hundred
and eighty, requisitions were entered for the new equipment
and clothing prescribed for troops going overseas, and doughboy
training, both in close order drill and road hikes, took the place
of mounted drill. Batteries E and F of the Field Artillery left
camp for a concentration point in Massachusetts, and the First
Separate Company entrained for Springfield, where they were
scheduled to guard the arsenal, leaving the 101st Machine Gun
Battalion, of which Troop A had become Company A, with the
Field Hospital the only occupants of the camp.</p>

<p>Vaccination and inoculation, those terrors of all early experiences
in the army, held the stage on the afternoon of August
21, with the usual accompaniment of blanched faces and shaky
knees. It was at this particularly unfavorable time the
announcement was made by Captain Wolf that the ranks were
to be brought up to the strength required by the addition of a
number of men from the 1st Vermont regiment of infantry.
This organization had been split up to complete units forming
the 26th Division.</p>

<p>Leaving the impression that he had been called to attend an
officers' school, Lieutenant Condren left the following day, and
the end of his journey found him in France, one of the first
National Guard officers to reach his goal. Within a few days
Lieutenant Nelson arrived with the Vermont contingent, and
Lieutenants Carroll and Bacharach were assigned to duty with
the Company by Major Howard, so that nearly a full complement
of officers was available for duties mainly of an ornamental
nature.</p>

<p>Having been duly welcomed as "Green Mountain Boys," and,
in the manner of the Company, christened "Apple Knockers,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the Vermont men were received into the fellowship of the organization.
Upon their arrival the newcomers occupied a company
street of their own, the work of erecting it having been conferred
upon A Company, as many similar and equally arduous honors
were conferred upon that unit while it remained a member of
the 101st Machine Gun Battalion. The apportionment of the
men to the different companies completed, forty-six of the Vermonters
came to A Company, most of whom held non-commissioned
officers' warrants or had attained the dignity
accompanying the rank of private first class.</p>

<p>Since the edict had gone forth that an old cavalry organization
was to become a "doughboy" outfit, and the yellow hat cord of
gallant memory was to be replaced by the blue of the lowly
infantry "with the dirt behind their ears," the order had been
more or less completely ignored, so that drills had the appearance
of a disciplinary formation at a large army post where both
arms of the service were represented. This brought out an order
which caused all cords to change magically to the endorsed blue
color, at least until the men reached a safe distance from camp,
where the change could be effected without danger of apprehension,
for who would dare return to New Haven wearing the
colors he had frowned upon in happier times? Leather leggins
were threatened, but the blow never descended and the "doughboys"
from Yale Field continued to salute the brilliantly polished
puttees of the men from Niantic as they strutted down Church
Street.</p>

<p>Manifestations of grief at the passing of the yellow hat cords
took the form of a funeral procession on the evening of August
30, when, preceded by Corporal Curtiss and Guerrant rendering
portions of the "Dead March" on bugle and harmonica, the men
as mourners marched with measured tread to the parade ground.
They followed a plank which served as a bier for a representative
of the deposed cords, and, after a dance symbolical of their
grief, the pallbearers laid it to rest, while Shemitz, with the
powers characteristic of his race, paid a glowing tribute to the
deceased. After hymns had been sung the crowd broke up to
hide its tears and console itself in the various ways which have
become common to mankind, or were common before prohibition
placed its clammy hand on the vitals of the universal consoler.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>Muster on the afternoon of August 31 was followed a week
later by pay day with a trip to New Haven that night for most
of the men and a ride back to camp on the 2:20. This train
made several unscheduled stops near the Niantic station because
the conductor was adamant toward pleas from the men and
would have carried them to New London had they not taken the
matter into their own hands and opened the air valves when
close to Niantic.</p>

<p>Bill Bell's famous and much maligned whistle made its appearance
during this period, for First Sergeant McGeer had departed
for the Officers' Training Camp at Plattsburg, and the one long
and one short signal was in order for any time of the day or
night. Because it was rumored that McGeer would return to
the Company if unsuccessful in his quest for a commission, he
received the best wishes of all the men and was treated to a
shower bath in his bunk the night before he left&mdash;an honor
accorded to but few men in the Company.</p>

<p>Straw ticks had been issued and they were filled and put to
use now to replace the cots, which, in various stages of demolition,
had been turned in and, according to the best information,
sent to Camp Devens to accommodate the first men of the selective
draft to arrive at that cantonment.</p>

<p>Fall weather, with its snappy morning air and delightful days,
gradually replaced the warmer days of late summer, enthroning
football in the place baseball had occupied. The first game was
a heart-breaking affair in which neither A Company nor B
Company was able to score, the second was also a tie in which
C Company scored seven points equally with A Company, and
the third was disastrous for the finances of the old Company,
for D Company, formerly M Troop, scored four touchdowns
to one for A.</p>

<p>All plans were interrupted on September 23, when orders
were sent out from Battalion Headquarters to strike tents and
roll packs preparatory to leaving the camp. This accomplished,
with a day's cooked rations issued and loaded down with packs
which would have taxed the capacity of the staunchest of pack
mules and taken prizes for the variety of form and number of
bundles and bags hung over them, the column, in command of
Captain Wolf, toiled out through the streets of Niantic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
interminably along the roads leading in the direction of New
London. Halts for rest were short and infrequent, and the one
called for the noon lunch seemed to be the only event which
could have saved from complete collapse many in the long,
struggling procession.</p>

<p>There was much speculation on the truth of the rumor that
a train was awaiting the men before they finally saw the head of
the column turn back toward Niantic. A squad of grinning
cooks stood at present arms with brooms and sticks of wood,
but this sight did not tend to sweeten the tempers of the returning
men who found they must again pitch their tents and rearrange
their belongings to the best advantage for a longer stay.
Sweetly worded memoranda from Headquarters conveyed the
information that the Major was pleased with the showing the
men had made in breaking camp, but they failed to explain why
orders prohibiting men from riding in any form of conveyance
on the march did not apply to a man from C Company who
rode by several times while the column was on the march and
turned on the men gazes of pitying condescension.</p>

<p>Cosmopolitan elements were added to the Company by the
acquisition of several men from the draft contingent and Corporal
Charles Nutt was assigned the post of instructor and guide
over the new men, all but one of whom were destined to complete
the tour of duty with the Company. Conscientious Charlie
watched over his men like a hen with a brood of new chicks,&mdash;he
took them to mess, to the supply tent, answered for them at
reveille and retreat, and drilled them during the hours set apart
for that purpose.</p>

<p>Politics played its part in the life of the men when on election
day, October 2, they were transported to New Haven in automobiles
by the Republicans or were given railroad transportation
by the Democrats, while the stern non-partisan element travelled
by freight or graft. The ardent voters were almost persuaded
to remain when word came that pay was ready to be distributed
on that day, but the call home was stronger and they returned
to get their share of the funds the following morning.</p>

<p>Another method of getting home was discovered shortly after
this, and with a special train chartered for team and rooters,
most of the Company, with the exception of certain members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
from Vermont who had travelled home for a visit without going
through the formalities of asking permission, left for New
Haven at noon Saturday, October 7, on a final trip and to play
a game of football against the Annex A. C., one of the strongest
semi-professional teams in the state. Sunday, the day of the
game, was ideal, but the opposing team was too strong for the
soldiers and came out on the long end of a 20-0 score.</p>

<p>For some time previous to this, men in the habit of talking
to their friends over the telephone in camp found that remarks
indicating an expected move in the near future resulted in the
loss of their connection and a stern reprimand, so Monday's
preparations, while full of interest, were not unexpected.
Instructions on the conduct of the troops while travelling were
given out and full preparations made for leaving at a moment's
notice. There was no freight to be handled for all heavy
baggage had been packed and loaded into box cars nearly a
month before, leading the way to the port of embarkation.</p>

<p>Profiteering, at least from the point of view of the soldier,
had brought disfavor on a man who conducted a small store near
the grounds, so the last night in camp was selected by certain
bold spirits to have a final settlement with him. They completed
their task by earnest demolition of all property they could find
belonging to the accused individual. His complaint caused
assembly to be blown at headquarters and a strict check taken of
all men absent. Well-founded alibis were numerous, however,
and nothing came of the incident to reflect on the records of
any of the suspected men.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of Wednesday, October 9, orders were
again received to break camp. This time preparations gave
them a genuine flavor, and at 9:30, in a disagreeable rain, which
they were to know better after two winters in France, the men
started their journey, cheered on by the hospitable residents of
Niantic and full of eagerness to reach its end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="small">GOING OVER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Having but a small percentage of globe-trotters among their
number, the ensuing weeks on water and land were full of
interest for all the men, even the blasé travellers showing just
a hint of excitement during the trip through the submarine
danger zone. Although the day was dreary when the train
pulled away from the station at Niantic, the weather cleared as
the seacoast was left behind, and by the time Springfield was
passed the skies had cleared and the beauties of the tree-clad
hills of Vermont and New Hampshire adorned in their gorgeously
colored autumn foliage presented a glorious farewell to
the men as the setting sun added its roseate glow to their final
view of the U. S. A.</p>

<p>Travelling at night in a well-filled day coach has its difficulties
if one has the desire to snatch a few minutes of sleep, but most
of the men, thoroughly tired from their efforts of the past few
days and their broken sleep of the preceding nights, managed to
court slumber in some of the most amazing positions. At midnight
all were aroused at White River Junction, Vermont, to be
served coffee, the quality of which ever after was an unfailing
object of invectives and a taunt to the Vermont members of the
Company.</p>

<p>After circling the city of Montreal, the train arrived at 6
o'clock the following morning on the pier near His Majesty's
Ship <i>Megantic</i>, and within an hour the entire Battalion with its
baggage had been hurried aboard, A and B Companies to occupy
the hold of the ship, with C and D in the second class cabins.
At 10 o'clock the ship left the pier and began the journey down
the St. Lawrence river. Of course the river was calm, and with
a berth ticket and a mess ticket safely in their grasp, most of
the men spent their time in exploring the ship as far as was
permitted and viewing the pastoral scenery of Quebec and
Labrador.</p>

<p>Early in the evening of October 11 the ship passed under
Victoria bridge and stopping at the historic city of Quebec took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
aboard two hundred Serbian reservists in their quaint costumes,
loaded down with baggage of all descriptions. The following
morning the pitching and tossing of the ship produced some
doubt in the minds of many as to the wisdom of leaving the
blankets. Then followed a day of misery and dejection for all
except those few and fortunate ones who were not subject to
the attacks of "mal de mer."</p>

<p>To thoroughly appreciate the wonderful land-locked harbor
of Halifax one must pass through the rough water the men had
experienced and then watch the ship steam into the smoothest
of basins, protected as it is from the ocean by a wall of rocks
almost large enough to be called mountains. Here the <i>Megantic</i>
lay at anchor from Saturday afternoon until Sunday afternoon
when, after a hundred Canadian artillerymen had been added
to the passengers, the convoy, consisting of the transports <i>Baltic</i>,
<i>Scotia</i>, <i>Justicia</i> and <i>Megantic</i>, the tankers <i>Cherryleaf</i> and <i>Cloverleaf</i>,
a British auxiliary cruiser and a tramp freighter, steamed
out of the harbor. With the entire passenger list assembled at
boat drill and standing at attention, bands on the British warships
lying in the harbor played "The Star Spangled Banner"
as the transports passed by.</p>

<p>Perhaps that moment might be catalogued as one of the most
poignant thrills of a lifetime. The men were leaving behind
them the land to which they might never return. They faced
first the dangers of the submarines, and if they passed safely
through that menace still greater perils awaited them. There
were those who covered their emotion well while the bands
played the National Anthem, but there was a long silence even
after the harbor of Halifax was far to the stern and the ship
was reaching out into the first real ground swells which
betokened their presence on the boundless Atlantic.</p>

<p>Routine on board ship was rather irksome to men who had
been free a good share of the time in camp to follow the dictates
of their own desires. Twice daily there were boat drills, and
there were calisthenics and even short classes in various subjects
during dull hours. One of the most mystifying things about
the ship was the seeming regularity with which passageways
were opened and closed to traffic. It is related that while
"Tempy" Sullivan was on guard at one of the passageways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Captain Wolf nearly ascended the stairs before that astute person
discovered him, whereupon, in spite of all the Captain's
pleas, he was forced to descend the way he had come and try
another place. "Them's my orders," said Sullivan with stony
determination when the Captain explained he was officer of the
day.</p>

<p>Ideas of English hospitality were given a set-back by the prices
which the stewards aboard ship charged for all commodities.
The prices of tobacco were prohibitive and there were no matches
to be had within a short time of sailing, and it was whispered
that the fruit being sold had been sent to the ship by the Red
Cross for free distribution among the soldiers. Beer was on
tap at the wet canteen after three days out.</p>

<p>Fair weather favored the ships until they started on a course
which was to take them to the north of Ireland, when they met
fog, rain and hail in varying quantities until Sunday, October
21, a day before sighting the west coast of Scotland, the weather
cleared. On the afternoon of that day an escort of nine British
destroyers made its appearance, bobbing on the large waves like
corks in a wash-tub and dashing through the convoy, flashing
their signals with heliographs by day and blinkers by night.</p>

<p>Wales was sighted on the starboard the morning of October
23 and that night at 7 o'clock, after waiting for some time in
the Mersey for a pilot, the troops debarked onto Liverpool's
famous floating dock, immediately boarding the queer little
English trains, which waited nearby. On the trip following the
men had their first sight of Englishwomen engaged in men's
work and garbed in the unconventional overalls and jumpers
which later became common at home. A short stop was made
at Birmingham where coffee almost as bad as the White River
Junction brand was handed out. Some of the men survived
the crush at the lunch counter to discover later that the patriotic
workers there had given them almost half as much as they had
bought. At 4:30 the next morning the train stopped at Borden
and the Battalion hiked about four miles through the mud in a
drizzling rain to Oxley, where watersoaked, leaky tents were
assigned while the cooks used all their magic to coax a fair meal
out of the available rations.</p>

<p>Tramping around in the mud which was at all times ankle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
deep and often deeper, a Y. M. C. A. hut was discovered with a
small stock of food and an American in charge. Here change
was made from American to English money and most of the
supplies available were purchased. Rest that night was more or
less disturbed and wishes were expressed for that dry little bunk
in the ship. The rain always found a hole just above the sleepers
and there was no way of repairing the leak. At that, the men
fared better than the officers, for the tents of the latter were
located in a wind-swept area and the high winds of the night
levelled them completely.</p>

<p>At 4 o'clock the following morning it was up and going again.
This time the train passed down through the sunny green fields
of the English countryside (for the rain had abated during the
early hours) past farmhands tilling the soil behind neatly
trimmed hedges, through cities which hid beneath their appearance
of calm a hive of industry, to the port of Southampton,
where another rest camp was the prospect. Like that at Borden,
this proved to be muddy, but duck-boards helped in this difficulty.
Here were American marines doing police duty, German
prisoners at work on the roads and the interesting buildings of
one of the oldest cities in the country. The stay here lasted
until October 29. Long before this, however, cash supplies had
dwindled to such an extent that but few of the men continued
to patronize the restaurants, although the food served at the
kitchen seemed barely sufficient to keep life in the body of a
healthy soldier.</p>

<p>Crowded aboard the channel steamer <i>Londonderry</i> with British
soldiers from all corners of the world, the trip across the English
Channel was begun after a long tedious wait, during which the
opportunity was afforded the men of seeing their first example
of what a torpedo could do to the side of a ship. The <i>Gloucester
Castle</i> lying in dry dock exhibited a wound through which a
fair sized motor truck could be driven. Passing out of the
harbor, the ship waited for darkness in the shelter of land and
then began that leaping, bounding journey of seven hours which
landed the Battalion in Le Havre, but first gave most of the men
one of their worst tastes of seasickness.</p>

<p>Le Havre offered the troops their first sight of French soil,
but it was not as pleasantly impressive as it might have been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
for toiling uphill four miles with all your belongings on your
back will make the most wonderful scenery in the world fade
into mediocrity without the added misfortunes of scanty supplies
and the same dreary weather which was encountered during the
stay in England.</p>

<p>Hydroplanes and dirigibles were sights for the men during
the twenty-four hours spent in Le Havre, but the status of
"Sunny France" had received its classification along with the
"Santa Claus" myth and subsequent months did not tend to disprove
this impression. Funds were at the lowest possible level.
Most of the spare cash scattered through the Company was made
up of the few shillings which were saved from the onslaughts
of the English merchants. Coupled with this was the much
lamented fact that extra rations supposed to meet the Battalion
in England had been side-tracked in some out-of-the-way place,
and they only reached the units for which they were intended
after they were well established in training camps in the Vosges.</p>

<p>Luckily the station platforms at Le Havre were covered with
bales of cotton when the Battalion arrived to entrain at 5:30 on
the afternoon of October 31, for these served as excellent beds
and they were universally utilized as such until the train was
ready to leave at midnight. The following day, with stops at
Nantes and Versailles for coffee and various halts all along the
line for reasons at no time apparent, after the manner of the
French railway systems, the troop train continued its eastward
journey, passing through Chateau Thierry and the scene of the
first battle of the Marne, through Troyes, where coffee and rum
were served by French soldiers, to the destination at Neufchateau,
where the headquarters of the 26th Division were located
and about which clustered the various units of that organization
during the period of training which followed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="small">TRAINING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At 9 o'clock on the morning of November 2 the Battalion
detrained at Neufchateau with hungry, travel-worn men willing
to unroll their packs in any place having the slightest appearance
of being a stationary camp, but it took all their optimism to greet
enthusiastically the mud-surrounded barracks provided for the
Company about three and a half miles southeast of Neufchateau
near the village of Certilleux, in the department of the Vosges.</p>

<p>Surrounded as it was by hills characteristic of that part of
France, and isolated from the other units of its command, A
Company developed its community along lines approved by
itself. The barracks, of which there were four on the east side
of the road and one on the opposite side, all of that temporary
type of structure manufactured in sections and reared without
much attempt at making them comfortable, were connected with
wide stone walks. The material for these walks was brought
from the hill near at hand after hours of labor which took the
kinks out of unused muscles and increased appetites, which were
far from being satisfied because of the addled condition of the
supply service then prevailing with the American Expeditionary
Forces.</p>

<p>Three of the group of four barracks were adopted for the
use of the Company, floors were laid, bunks of heavy green
wood which had to be carried from the railroad station nearly
a mile distant were gradually put into place, the kitchen was
installed in one of the barracks with the mess hall as an adjunct
and the orderly room occupying a small space near the end of
the latter. Finally the small cylindrical stoves, the only available
means of heating the barracks, were installed, three to a
building. The single barracks on the west side of the road was
fitted up for a guard house and supply room until the horses,
mules and gun carts claimed it for their own.</p>

<p>Detail work was plentiful, for water was supplied by a small
brook originating in springs near the top of the hill and it was
necessary to carry it a hundred yards to the kitchen. Coal for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the barracks stoves was only obtainable by carrying it from
points of distribution, for transportation was scarce early in the
fall of 1917. To supply the kitchen with wood, chopping details
were sent into areas designated by the French authorities and
the sticks were carried to camp by the Company.</p>

<p>Getting settled in the barracks was a comparatively short operation,
for the men had been making new homes during the past
month under more trying conditions each time, until they
considered board floors and more or less dependable roofs downright
luxuries. The bunks, most of which were of the "double-deck"
variety, that is, one superimposed over another, with
staunch wooden posts, were finally arranged in double rows on
each side of the barracks, leaving a broad aisle through the
center of the building. Sergeants who were fortunate enough
found small single bunks which they placed in the middle of the
barracks clustered around the stove which occupied the aisle
there. These bunks also made seats for the rest of the men
when winter nights made the space around the stove a coveted
commodity.</p>

<p>Upon invitation the 102d Regiment Band came to the mess
hall the Sunday following the Company's arrival at Certilleux
and raised the spirits of the men with a concert. Tuesday a
march was made to Neufchateau where steel helmets and full
machine gun equipment, as far as the guns and carts were concerned,
were drawn from the French ordnance depot there.
The equipment was hauled back to camp on a hike memorable
for its strenuous character.</p>

<p>Spare time had been curtailed in attempts to make the camp
tenable, but now was spent in gaining a first-hand knowledge of
the surrounding territory. These walks of exploration were cut
short by the announcement, November 10, that Mechanic Curtiss
had developed a case of measles and been sent to the hospital.
His case was followed by others, so the quarantine, applied
immediately, hedged in the Company and prevented it from
passing the borders of the little camp for nearly a month. First
Sergeant Bell, whose boundless energy was responsible for the
improvements made about the camp, took command of the situation
and did all within his power to add to the meager pleasures
of the men by holding impromptu entertainments in the mess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
hall. The first of these was his trial and conviction by a mock
court on serious charges preferred by Dockendorff; the sentence
recommended by the jury, of which Captain Wolf was foreman,
involved the loss of his whistle. Judge Carroll suspended execution
of judgment in view of the accused's early record and
Tony Scandore's band completed the program.</p>

<p>Other gatherings of equal interest were arranged, during which
the <i>Morning Scratch</i> was presented with its ephemeral owners
and contributors and its policy of "charity to none and malice
toward all." This remarkable paper not only attracted the attention
of the divisional censor, but outlived three editions in which
plain fabrication vied with outspoken truth in ferreting out the
peculiar qualities of well-known men in the organization. Sergeant
McCarthy and Corporal Malone acted as editors of this
worthy "sheet" but shielded the names of contributors to the
last.</p>

<p>Robinson and Stearns valiantly attacked the "general's march"
unceasingly when the word was passed down that General
Pershing was coming to inspect the Company on November 11.
Clothing and equipment were scrubbed as never before, but the
stigma of a quarantine saved the men the nerve-racking experience
of an inspection by the General, and the only sight they had
of him was when his car flashed past to Landaville where the
headquarters of the 102d Regiment was located.</p>

<p>After patiently translating most of the French handbook on
the Hotchkiss machine gun which was issued to the Company
the previous week, Lieutenants Carroll and Nelson transmitted
their information to the rest of the Company officers and the men
were called out for the first demonstration. Described as being
"air-cooled, gas operated and strip-fed," the gun was extremely
heavy but at the same time one of the most dependable machine
guns used in the war, and its comparatively simple mechanism
soon was well known by most of the men.</p>

<p>All during this time of acclimation "chow" was as scarce as
Mike Shea's speeches, kitchen police was a detail for which first
class privates strove and methods of adding to the slender rations
were many as well as devious. Matches were unheard of things,
cigarettes priceless luxuries. There were few men in the Company
who would not have pledged at least half of their next
month's pay for a satisfying supply of chocolate.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>All company officers being quartered in barracks a quarter
mile down the road with the exception of Captain Wolf, who
enjoyed the distinction of a clean, dry room with one of those
slumber-provoking French beds in a house in the village of
Certilleux, were relieved from quarantine restrictions, as were
Lacaillade and Hobart, who found refuge with the second battalion
of the 102d Regiment while measles, or the threats thereof,
held the camp in their grasp.</p>

<p>Drills in the handling of machine guns took up the attention
of most of the Company during the ensuing weeks, while the
headquarters section was trained in signalling and general liaison
work. Lieutenant Dolan was assigned to the Company as an
instructor and began his work with an interesting lecture on
"Gas in Modern Warfare," and the general atmosphere of war
was heightened by planes passing over the camp at all hours.
Columns of French artillery travelled in seemingly endless procession
in the direction of Epinal and the occasional booming of
the anti-aircraft guns in the defense of Toul and Nancy far to
the north of the camp came in intermittent echoes.</p>

<p>With a concrete floor, constructed by Shea and Delaney, and
equipped with a French type of water heater, consisting of a
large cauldron set over a very small fire box in which wood was
used as fuel, the company bathroom erected in the rear end of
barracks No. 222 was opened for general use on November 24.
Popular from the first day, this addition to the conveniences of
the camp was kept in operation by a company order decreeing
that each man must bathe at least once each week or as many
more times as he had the opportunity. One man was detailed
to keep the water at the right temperature and level in the heater,
so facilities for bathing were never lacking.</p>

<p>Arguments on the war, its probable end, the chances for the
Company to get to the "Front" and other topics fully as engrossing
were discussed about the fires at night until a seeming lack
of military knowledge among the men prompted an order which
brought about evening schools on "Drill Regulations" and other
phases of army life. A study of these tactics was pursued with
a thoroughness which would have been impossible to acquire
under the more distracting conditions at the camp back in
Niantic.</p>

<p>Boundless good fortune struck camp the day before Thanksgiving.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Turkey and special rations were issued and freight
containing cigarettes, tobacco and the company phonograph
arrived. Measles had entirely disappeared, so the quarantine
was lifted and allowed the men a freedom which had not been
theirs since the arrival in France. All night the kitchen police
and cooks toiled to make the holiday dinner one to be remembered,
and their efforts were rewarded, for they presented the
Company with a feast which in amount and variety would have
satisfied the wildest wish. Turkey and cranberry sauce reigned
supreme, severely crowded for popularity by sweet potatoes and
other vegetables, pumpkin pies, coffee and a barrel of beer.</p>

<p>In a program of athletic events arranged for the day, all but
necessary duties being suspended, the officers' race showed
Lieutenant Nelson to be the fleetest with Lieutenant Bacharach
a close second; McLaughlin bested the efforts of the sergeants,
with Curtiss but a few feet behind; Poirier grabbed the corporals'
contest, as well as the "free-for-all"&mdash;and Malone travelled
next. Cook Conroy running against the privates first
class took first prize and Johnson took second; Nutile, Rourke
and Hannon finished in that order when the privates took their
turn on the field. Thirty-two points was the total of the third
platoon's efforts when men from that group took the gun-squad
competition and the relay race. In the team scores they were
followed by the first platoon with nineteen to its credit, while
headquarters with seven points and the second platoon with five
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Following dinner, which was served at the conventional hour
of 6 o'clock and for which the third platoon, in recognition of
its prowess on the athletic field, stood first in line, prizes were
distributed to all successful contestants. The double quartette
which had been under the tutelage of Lieutenant Bacharach for
some time made its first appearance, the <i>Morning Scratch</i>
was heard through its second edition, and each of the officers
gave a short talk. Sergeant Bell bade farewell to the Company
because of his impending departure for the Army Candidate
School.</p>

<p>A succession of acting first sergeants followed when Sergeant
Bell left and Curtiss was finally picked for the permanent position.
Automatic weapon schools were patronized by Sergeants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Cramer, McLoughlin and Reilly and Corporals McKiernan and
Viebranz during the following month while the Company was
getting first experience in target practice under the guidance of
instructors assigned from the French Army.</p>

<p>On December 6 the first letters from home were received, and
four days later information was eagerly sought concerning the
French monetary system, for Lieutenant Nelson, as Battalion
Paymaster, gave out the pay due the Company in francs. For
a few days the shops of Neufchateau were deluged with chocolate
and souvenir seekers. Meager stores of French were overhauled
in the attempt to express needs to the merchants and the
services of French-speaking members of the outfit were rewarded
with liberal amounts of wine and all the eatables procurable.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="Mail" />
</div>


<p>Lieutenant Chester C. Thomas was assigned to the Company
from C Company of the Battalion. His original organization
was the Vermont regiment of which Lieutenant Nelson and
various enlisted men in the Company had been members. His
addition brought the number of officers in the Company to seven,
one in excess of the requirements of the tables of organization
and was the preparation for the removal of Captain Wolf, which
took place during the following month.</p>

<p>Christmas day brought more festivities. A tree was set up
in the mess hall and decorated in the approved manner with
candles and tinsel, the hall itself being transformed into a bower
of green and red through the efforts of the committee appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
to care for the arrangements. Turkey was again issued and the
supplies augmented by purchases at the commissary in Neufchateau.
Christmas packages from home which had been
arriving for some time were distributed by Captain Wolf and
every member of the Company was presented with a gift bought
from the Company fund. The Company in turn presented its
commander with a fur coat to aid him in withstanding the
rigors of a winter which was at no time gentle.</p>

<p>The day was enjoyed to the utmost. Buglers were silenced
so that the unusual pleasure of lying luxuriously in bunks could
be enjoyed for the first time. Much of the day was spent in
revelling in the contents of the boxes received from home. No
Christmas stocking of childhood ever held half the fascination of
those little packages. Everything brought back cherished memories
and the enjoyment was doubled by the fact that no duties
disturbed the calm of reflections. Following the dinner that
night the mess hall was cleared and a stage set up over the serving
tables in the kitchen, complete with an artistic backdrop decorated
in conventional style by Guerrant, a curtain which would
open in the center after sufficient coaxing, and footlights patiently
manufactured by Saddler Thompson from tobacco cans and
candles.</p>

<p>After Lieutenant Bacharach's orchestra had played an "overture"
and the Company filled mess hall seats, the double quartette
occupied the stage and gave a few well-received selections.
"Rubber" Callahan furnished the next feature, winning applause
by his nimble dancing. Then, with a setting almost theatrical,
McCarthy as cub reporter was ordered by Malone, as city editor,
to read certain excerpts from the third and final edition of the
<i>Morning Scratch</i>. News was plenty for this edition and
scandal was related with a true flavor, outdoing previous attempts
by so much that serious consequences threatened for a time
after the edition appeared in public.</p>

<p>After the quartette had again offered its best to the audience,
Poirier, Foster and Hunihan presented a melodramatic sketch
in which Poirier played the part of the villain, Foster that of
the trusting wife and Hunihan that of the honest young workingman
who was tempted but thought better of it and sold the
old pistol to buy chocolate for the baby, putting an end to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
situation which threatened to become painful. Eddie O'Neill
entertained with his best steps and then Hobart and Cath
appeared on the stage, the former in the garb of a Scotchman
(or so it was said to be) and the latter in a combination of attire
which surpasses any power of description because of its varied
character. After a brief and wholly unnecessary bit of persiflage
these ambitious entertainers broke forth in song which
would have been passed on mercifully by those present had not
Hobart essayed an encore which was more than the audience
could stand and they exhibited their disapproval by showering
the stage with all movable objects.</p>

<p>Eddie Malone added to the interest of the day by vanquishing
three visitors from a neighboring camp in such a manner that
they promised revenge, and began a return with augmented
forces, but abandoned their enterprise before they reached the
camp and returned to their own barracks.</p>

<p>No turkey was repeated for New Year's Day, but a pig was
purchased from a nearby farmer and proved a welcome addition
to the rations.</p>

<p>British and French gas masks issued the day before Christmas
were used constantly in drills. Two long, tiresome days were
spent in the drillgrounds of the infantry, where trenches were
simulated by paths through the snow and where the inactivity
produced severe trouble with frostbitten feet, forcing Ralph
Moore to go to the hospital for a considerable stay.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Condren assumed command of the Company when
Captain Wolf left to become divisional billeting officer on January
13, inaugurating his reign by confining all members of the
Company to camp and advancing the hour of reveille forty-five
minutes because of the disappearance of two cans of milk from
the kitchen. The mystery of the milk remained unsolved, however,
and five days later the regular schedule of calls was
resumed. All during the following month Sundays were taken
up with drills or fatigue work, not to mention the endless inspections
which make the lives of all soldiers miserable.</p>

<p>Major Howard, in command of the Battalion during all this
time, graced the company with visits only on two occasions.
Orders were received from the headquarters of the 101st
Machine Gun Battalion, but it soon became evident that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
identity of Company A was to be changed, for orders were issued
causing that organization to be placed under the command of
the major of the 102d Machine Gun Battalion for "instruction
and training." These orders were never rescinded and in due
time D Company of the 102d Machine Gun Battalion was designated
as a permanent title and A Company of the 101st Machine
Gun Battalion passed into oblivion, along with Troop A, Connecticut
National Guard. In accomplishing this stroke, Major
Howard also succeeded in having D Company of his battalion
transferred to the 103d Machine Gun Battalion, leaving him in
command of the two Hartford companies which now became
the divisional reserve, equipped with motor transportation and
held out of the line during the greater part of the campaigns
which followed.</p>

    <span class="xsmall">ONE OF THE PIGS SLEPT WITH DUGGAN</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Final preparation for the first trip to the trenches which the
men were told would take place early in February consisted in
training the mules issued to the Company to haul the gun-carts,
ammunition carts, caissons, rolling kitchens and escort wagons,
inspections without number, trips to the machine gun range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
where all the guns in the division were assembled for practice,
and the policing ever necessary before an organization could
leave a camp it had occupied.</p>

<p>Pay and mail brought more joy to the camp on January 23
and the following nights were spent visiting the nearby cafés
or, when opportunity offered, taking the quaint train which conveyed
the men to and from Neufchateau at a cost of two cents
per trip in real money. The fate of five small pigs dropped
from a train in the vicinity of camp was promptly decided by
Minor and Parmalee, who captured them and after a night spent
by most of the Company trying to keep the porkers in captivity,
they were killed and served at mess the following day.</p>

<p>Trips to the machine gun range laid out by one member of
the Company in coöperation with a man from Battalion headquarters
near Prez sous Lafauche, southwest of Neufchateau,
were made by French motor truck. There the men had their
first demonstration of barrage fire over the heads of friendly
troops, were addressed for the first time by Major General
Clarence R. Edwards, commander of the Division, and Colonel
Parker, famed throughout the army for his work in connection
with the development of the machine gun and at that time the
energetic commander of the 102d Infantry Regiment, who, in
his direct manner described vividly the part machine guns were
intended to play in the war.</p>

<p>Interspersed with machine gun work was instruction in
grenade throwing and the final test of the gas masks when the
entire Company passed through a chamber filled with chlorine
gas.</p>

<p>Farewell was bade the camp which had served as a home for
more than three months on February 7, when after a final and
extensive policing, the Company slung packs and began the hike
over the hill leading to Chatenois and eventually to the trenches.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="small">CHEMIN DES DAMES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Early plans of the War Department for training troops in
France included a period during which the "Yanks" were
brigaded with French or British units to spend a probationary
time in the lines, when they received instruction in trench routine,
were taken on raiding expeditions by the veteran fighters of the
Allies and received their baptism of fire, often very severe when
the Hun discovered the presence of green troops on the front.
It was on this course of training the Company was bound when
just at dusk on February 7 packs were slung and the men began
their struggle up the ice-covered hill on the road to Chatenois.</p>

<p>Experience in hiking to the trenches soon taught enlisted men
that the primitive life on the front line did not call for various
accoutrements thought necessary in the barracks, or at least it
was much easier to do without certain articles than it was to
carry them. This first trip, however, saw packs, bundles and
bags such as had adorned the men when they left Niantic. By
the time they reached the top of the hill back of the camp,
although many rests had intervened during the climb, resolutions
galore were made concerning the amount to be packed on another
trip. With very little climbing to do on the rest of the journey,
it was made in good time, and under the supervision of Lieutenant
Paton the gun carts and wagons were loaded onto the
waiting train, after which rations for the trip were drawn for
each car and the men made themselves comfortable for the night.</p>

<p>Sleeping on the floor of a box car had no terrors for the men
who had spent the past three months on the hard bunks of the
barracks, so the bumping, swaying progress of the train leaving
early the following morning failed to disturb the rest of most
of the sleepers. The next day as the train passed through
Epernay, Bar le Duc and Chalons-sur-Marne, wooden crosses
on the graves of the first valiant defenders of the Marne and
houses wrecked by shell fire and flames brought clearly to their
minds the step they were taking toward the completion of a task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
other men had found hard. The naturally light-hearted spirit
of the Company prevented any depression and singing could be
heard from end to end of the train as it rolled along on the
grand line of France through some of the prettiest scenery that
land affords. Travelling most of the time through valleys where
the tiny villages dotted with white the green of early spring
crowning the hills on all sides, "Sunny France" became more
of a reality and the spirit of her men, fighting to preserve these
peaceful scenes, became more thoroughly appreciated as some
of its inspiration dawned upon their brothers in Democracy.</p>

<p>Early evening found the train at Dormans, a short distance
east of Chateau-Thierry, and from there a branch line was followed
to Braisne, a town less than six months before in the
hands of the Hun. War zone rules prevailed here and the
unloading was done mainly in darkness but accomplished quickly.
At the end of a ten kilometer march the Battalion was billeted in
the ruined city of Vailly. To D Company fell a hut of similar
type to the ones used as barracks in Certilleux. Sleep was curtailed
the next morning by orders to move to the security of
dugouts and cellars with which the city was filled. During the
balance of the day explorations were in order, for the surrounding
country offered limitless opportunities to observe the havoc
wrought by war. Twice the opposing armies had battled
through this portion of the department of Aisne, so that trenches,
observation posts and graves of soldiers of both powers were
plentiful.</p>

<p>Airplanes passed time and again on their missions over the
lines. Men of the Company saw their first struggle between
aviators, viewed breathlessly the feat of a German birdman who
destroyed a French observation balloon and the escape of the
observer from the basket of the "blimp" in a parachute. The
camouflage screens used so extensively during the war were
much in evidence here as the roads were open to enemy observation.
All other artifices of war as it had been developed since
the introduction of trench fighting were to be seen in abundance.</p>

<p>On the night of February 10 C Company of the 102d Machine
Gun Battalion entered the line at Froidmont Farm and took
positions turned over to them by the French along the slopes of
the famous ridge crowned for the distance of about four kilometers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
by the Chemin des Dames, from which the sector took
its name.</p>

<p>Packs were rolled on short notice in the afternoon of the 13th
and a march of four kilometers to the east took the Company to
the ruined village of Chavonne where the wagon train established
quarters and above which the Company was billeted in
caves called "Les Grenouilles" (the frogs). Here were electric
lights and wooden floors and French Army canteens nearby, but
luxuries lost their interest when a German aviator and his
machine, felled perhaps three months before, were discovered in
a shell-pitted field near the cave.</p>

<p>Preparations for the coming trip to the front were continued,
the guns polished and oiled to the last degree, carts thoroughly
overhauled and personal equipment put in proper order. Aerial
activity offered the only distraction from duty. One bright
day when the entire Company was viewing a combat between
Allied and German planes from the hill above its appointed
home, General Peter E. Traub (at that time in command of the
51st Infantry Brigade, of which the Company was a part) made
an impromptu visit, resulting in a comprehensive and forceful
lecture from that officer on the proper deportment of soldiers
when enemy planes came into view.</p>

<p>According to the routine established reconnaissance parties
preceded their respective companies into the line by twenty-four
hours to allow a relief without endangering the strength of the
position. In conformity with this Lieutenant Condren, with a
representative from each section, went ahead of the Company.
On February 16 Lieutenant Thomas led the balance of the
command up through Ostel, where dusk was awaited because of
the exposed road to be traversed between that village and Froidmont
Farm, the objective of the Company. From there they
marched down the road in sections into the cave cut from the
soft limestone deposit from which the first and second platoons
took positions in the first line, with the third remaining in the
cave as a reserve.</p>

<p>One of the wonders of the war, that cave had a capacity of
about ten thousand men, most of whom could be furnished with
sleeping quarters. It was equipped with electric lights burned
only during certain hours of the day, officers' quarters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
kitchens for a limited number of men and the ever present
French canteen with its stock of wine and chocolate.</p>

<p>Passing through the cave, the men designated to take the
first shift on the line found travelling difficult when they reached
the stairs leading up and out at the front. These were narrow
and steep with roof so low that "Duke" Rowley's equipment
wedged him in and he was forced to have some of it removed
before he could continue. Finally reaching the outside, guides
were waiting to conduct the squads to the replacements they
were to occupy, and after guns were set up all but a guard for
each gun sought the dugouts, which were deep, small and unventilated.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="Detail" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="xsmall">CHEMIN DES DAMES&mdash;RATION DETAIL.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>One of the difficulties of duty in this part of the line was the
disposal of the kitchen which was finally left near Ostel in a
depression which became known as the forerunner of a long
line of "Shrapnel Valleys" for the smoke from the fires always
presented a fair target to Hun gunners. From here the "grub"
was carried to the men in the line in large marmite cans constructed
with the idea of keeping food warm and fitted with
handles supposed to make them more easily portable. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
trips accomplished twice each day by details from each section
were often fraught with danger, for the Hun insisted on "strafing"
the road at the most inopportune times, and hairbreadth
escapes were daily topics while the gun squads waited in their
dugouts.</p>

<p>Accustomed to activity of a strenuous sort during most of
their waking hours, the men found trench warfare irksome,
wondering at the businesslike attitude adopted by the doughty
French soldiers who took their trips to the trenches much as
most Americans take their daily work in peace times. Chaffing
under the restraint, McAviney and Parmalee produced life-sized
bombardments one night for the benefit of Lieutenants Bacharach
and Carroll by throwing hand grenades over the parapet
until their tactics were discovered.</p>

<p>Gas alarms and drills, airplanes passing over and one call
for a barrage which brought a prompt response from the Company
guns broke the monotony of the stay. The main source of
amusement, however, was watching the shells from American
batteries break in the village of Chevregny, which with Monampteuil
occupied the ridge on the opposite side of the valley in the
German lines. Through this valley ran the Ailette River, a
tributary of the Oise, as did the canal connecting the Oise with
the Aisne.</p>

<p>Relieved by C Company February 22, the Company proceeded
back to quarters at Chavonne.</p>

<p>Turkey was on the menu for the 24th and arrangements were
made with Dr. Johnston, of the Y. M. C. A., so that each man
was allowed a limited amount of credit at his canteen, for all
were penniless as usual. Added to these luxuries was a bath
for everyone obtainable at a station in Vailly loaned by the
French authorities.</p>

<p>Soupir, St. Mard and Cys-la-Commune, the latter two south
of the Aisne, were visited by the men during the next two days.
Some of the officers also made the trip to the neighboring towns.
Lieutenants Nelson and Paton, returning from a purchasing
expedition and failing to find the road leading across the bridge,
commandeered a raft which failed them in mid-stream and
their supplies were resting on the bottom of the river when they
succeeded in reaching the bank.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>On their second trip to the lines, made on the night of the
27th, the Company officers decided it would be necessary to pass
through the cave, and after a long struggle through twisted
paths, barbed wire, broken trench timbers and mud worse than
ordinary because of a recent fall of snow, the men reached their
assigned positions.</p>

<p>With the exception of a raid conducted by the French in
coöperation with members of the 101st Infantry Regiment, on
the left of the Company positions, followed by intermittent bombardments
of retaliation by both sides, the second shift in the
trenches for the members of old Troop A was uneventful.
Routine duties continued until Friday, March 8, when French
soldiers relieved them and they returned to billets at Chavonne.
The Hun's farewell was enthusiastic, high explosives and gas
shells expressing his hatred for the new units in the line. A
bombing squadron bound for Paris passed above the men as
they trudged back through Ostel and gas shells were so numerous
that much of the trip was made with the masks adjusted.</p>

<p>In preparation for eventualities, the French authorities were
constructing defensive positions protected by barbed wire for
several miles to the rear of the lines they then occupied. It
was into some of these just to the rear of American batteries
near Ostel that part of D Company was sent on the day following
its relief from the front line. Life at these posts was ideal,
duties were cut to a minimum, food was brought in plentiful
quantities to the doors of the dugouts, and with pay day on the
Wednesday following the relief, French canteens were liberally
patronized. Excellent weather prevailed during the rest of the
stay in this sector and when the Battalion left Chavonne for
Braisne March 18 impressions concerning the character of war
were of a high nature for the Company had passed through its
training period with no casualties and but few real hardships.</p>

<p>On the march from Chavonne to Braisne, the men again
passed through Vailly, following the same road it had covered
in making the trip to the lines. All along the way were evidences
that the thrifty French were making every attempt to
cultivate all available land. Most of the fields the Hun had
held for nearly four years up to the preceding fall were green
with new crops and cattle grazed among the mazes of barbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
wire both armies had left in their haste. Braisne seen for the
first time during daylight bore few of the scars of war, for the
retreat first of the French and then of the German armies had
been precipitous in this particular region.</p>

<p>Leaving at 11:30 that night the train moved out in the rain
always in evidence when D Company was moving. Travelling
all the following day the troops were detrained at Brienne le
Chateau in the department of the Aube, about one hundred miles
from Neufchateau, where the march to Vesaignes sous Lafauche
for that mythical rest began in the usual drizzle. The journey
ended for that day when the Company arrived at La Chaise,
where quarters for all the men were taken in a large barn.
Twelve kilometers to Ville sur Terre finished the task for the
next day and this quiet little village was made the scene of
deeply felt orations delivered by Sergeant Curtiss and Maiden
to the crowd in the village square on varied topics, the spirits
of the entire Company apparently bolstered by purchases in the
cafés. Two more days here and the Battalion again moved
under orders to participate in a war game which German successes
on the British front were soon to cancel.</p>

<p>Through Thil, Nully, Blumery to Dommartin le St. Pere the
men trudged on a twenty-one kilometer march Saturday, March
23. Conversation with people at that place revealed that it was
being used by the French as a refuge for many of the peasants
driven from their homes near the Belgian border. Sunday's
trip was to Nomecourt, a distance of thirteen kilometers. The
following day the route lay through Joinville and Poissons to
Maconcourt. The next day twelve kilometers more found the
Battalion in Chambroncourt and Wednesday, March 27,
Vesaignes sous Lafauche with its fleeting promise of a rest
came into view, completing a hike which had required six marching
days and during which over sixty-five miles had been
covered.</p>

<p>The journey had not been tiresome, for the weather had
been favorable with the exception of two days. The beauties
of France, hidden by shell holes and barbed wire in the vicinity
of the lines and mud and snow during the Company's early
training period, had begun to be evident in the smiling countryside
which greeted the men on their trip. Fields were either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
green with new crops or brown where the earth had been freshly
plowed, trees were showing the bright green of new leaves and
the white roads in excellent repair which traversed the entire
section seemed as ribbons binding together the tiny villages
snuggled in the nooks among the hills, with neatly trimmed
hedges and backgrounds of stately poplars along the banks of
the little streams, producing an impression of peace and love
in contrast with the hate and destruction of the front.</p>

<p>Assigned to barracks on the edge of the town, D Company
proceeded to the task of unpacking barracks bags and settling
down for a stay. This was rudely interrupted within two days
when the smashing attacks of the Hun hordes against the British
had met with such success that General Foch, in command of
the Allied armies, found it necessary to use all available reserves.
To this end the 102d Machine Gun Battalion, with the rest of
the 26th Division, was ordered to the sector northwest of Toul
as a relief for the 1st Division, which, with its record of nearly
three months training in the lines, was needed where serious
activity was impending.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="small">THE TOUL SECTOR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Orders on the morning of March 30 sent the Battalion to
Trampot, about fifteen kilometers away. There Easter Sunday
was spent in the rain, which had prevailed for two days, as was
customary when the organization moved.</p>

<p>On April 1 the men with their guns and ammunition were
loaded into trains of motor trucks for the trip to the front, the
carts and kitchen having started the journey by road the
previous day.</p>

<p>The route of the trucks lay through Neufchateau, center of
the 26th Division training area, Domremy, the birthplace of
Joan of Arc, to Boucq, divisional headquarters for the new area,
which was known as the sector of Boucq, or Foret de La Reine
to the French authorities, but more commonly called the Toul
sector because of its location northwest of that ancient city.
In the trenches of this part of the line long, tedious days were
spent, broken by weary hikes through the mud to a rest camp
for a day or so, only to pack and return to another section.
The experience gained in becoming accustomed to shell fire,
getting the most out of meager protection afforded and observation
of enemy tactics, proved its value in the lives it saved
when the Company went into action later in the year.</p>

<p>After landing in Boucq the men were assigned to barracks
near the village. The cooks who had started with the wagon
train from Vesaignes failed to put in an appearance but culinary
talent was not lacking, and Ackerman and Parmalee prepared
the meals until the kitchen arrived. Orders were confused
during the following two days and it was not till the morning
of April 3 that directions were received sending the Company
northwest of Broussey at the extreme left of the sector occupied
by the 51st Brigade. Ammunition and equipment were carried
to the front on the narrow gauge railroad from Broussey, to
which point the Company was transported in trucks.</p>

<p>Rain added to the difficulties of finding a way through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
heavily wooded swamp. Confronting the men on their way to
the positions assigned the three mile hike from Broussey was
one of the worst trips in their experience. Continually in the
mud, sometimes over their boots and dropping every few yards
into shallow creeks crossing their path, forcing their way through
passages overgrown with underbrush and stumbling over broken
duck-boards, the men, nearly exhausted, finally reached the
wooden shacks used as shelters. Just two days late, they relieved
the 1st Division unit which had been languidly fulfilling the
necessary duties of the sector.</p>

<p>Partly protected wooden and iron huts described by Lieutenant
Nelson as being "shell-proof until a shell hits one of
them," were distributed about a central point in the Bois de
Besombois and here the entire Company, with the exception of
"mule-skinners" and other members of the train section, was
quartered. Two hundred yards distant was the front line
located in another wood designated Bouqueteau. To the right
of these positions in the direction of Pont à Mousson for a distance
of fourteen kilometers the 51st Brigade held the line,
while to the left for ten kilometers the 52d Brigade with the
remaining units of the 26th Division occupied the trenches, its
left resting within a comparatively short distance of St. Mihiel.</p>

<p>In this sector there were but few trenches, as the character
of the ground made it impractical for the enemy to attempt
much of an advance in this direction. It was protected on the
right by marshy lakes and on the left by strong defenses on
higher ground. To the right could be seen the forbidding
German stronghold of Montsec, with Xivray and Seicheprey in
the distance, later the scenes of the earliest actions in which
American units participated, while on the left was the Apremont
region, where the 104th Infantry Regiment won distinction
repulsing a German raid.</p>

<p>Expressing contempt for the "Malishy" the men of the 1st
Division left the sector with the apparent feeling that it would
soon be overrun by the Boche, but before going they transmitted
more faithfully than they did many of their orders stories about
American raids on the Hun lines which had penetrated through
the last defense and had netted but one prisoner, a decrepit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
pensioner who travelled with the aid of a wooden leg and
carried flares which he set off at intervals throughout the system
of trenches. In spite of their feeling in the matter the Hun
continued quiet for several days, using vari-colored lights and
machine gun bullets to while away the long hours of darkness.
A gas alarm broke the stillness on the 5th and the following
night brought action for Gould's and Hunihan's guns, who fired
on signal from the infantry, but nothing further developed.</p>

<p>Almost incredible news was received on the night of the 9th,
when orders came sending Sergeant "Tom" Reilly home as one
of the fifty men selected to represent the American Expeditionary
Force during the campaign for the Second Liberty Loan.
When he left he had more messages for the home folks than
he could have delivered personally in a month.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="Stinky" />
</div>


<p>Although a certain amount of shelling by both sides had
occurred periodically ever since the Company entered the lines,
the heavy bombardment which began early on the morning of
the 20th betokened action in some part of the Brigade sector.
Later news showed this activity to have taken place preceding
and during the German attack on Seicheprey. There a battalion
of picked shock troops had pierced the lines held by the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
battalion of the 102d Infantry Regiment and A and B Companies
of the 102d Machine Gun Battalion, finding its way
through a mist which filled the low ground in front of Jury
Woods. The enemy had surrounded certain units, including a
platoon of B Company of the Battalion and most of D Company
of the infantry, nearly all of whom were carried away prisoners.
After inflicting damage as far as they could they were forced
to retire before a counter attack, leaving hundreds of dead in
their wake, while their wounded in unknown numbers had been
carried off in the retreat. This was the first engagement of its
size fought by American troops.</p>

<p>Just previous to this attack, Major John D. Murphy, formerly
a captain in the 101st Infantry Regiment, was placed in command
of the Battalion and Captain Gallup, who had been acting
major, returned to lead C Company.</p>

<p>The air was filled with rumors which gain headway when
there is a dearth of subjects to be discussed. One said that
the Company was to be withdrawn and the personnel used as
instructors, another that the unit was on the verge of being
sent home for some hazy purpose and a trip to Italy was even
invented. All were discredited however, when, after thirty days
continuous duty in the lines C Company, 103d Machine Gun
Battalion, completed its relief of the Company during the night
of May 2 and the men hiked westward along a road screened
with camouflage to Girauvoisin, whence three sections went
forward to Fort Liouville and relieved part of B Company,
101st Machine Gun Battalion, taking positions which seemed
ideal. With beds and good rooms on the very front line, the
men rested until relieved on the 14th by B Company of their
Battalion, when they hiked the eighteen kilometers intervening
between their position and La Rehanne Woods, the location of
the train.</p>

<p>La Rehanne Woods, located on the road running from Toul
north through Menil la Tour and Ansauville, Battalion Headquarters,
to Beaumont and Seicheprey, served as the rest camp
for the Company during the remainder of its stay in the Toul
sector, being comparatively free from shelling and therefore
largely used by all units in that area.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>Under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A., the Herron sisters provided
entertainment Sunday, the 19th. In the afternoon of that
day Art Parmalee fought six rounds with Jensen of the 163d
Infantry, winning the honors with ease and adding considerably
to the wealth of his backers,&mdash;practically the entire Company.
The following days were filled with the usual explorations of
surrounding villages and pay for March and April on the 21st
would have given more latitude to these trips had not the Company
departed for positions in Jury Woods that night when units
of the 162d French Regiment were relieved.</p>

<p>Accommodations were available for only half the Company
in these positions so the rest of the men returned to La Rehanne
to await their turn. In Jury Woods men on the guns had considerable
practice in barrage work, for on two occasions the
signal was sent up by the infantry and promptly responded to
by all guns on the line. It was learned afterward that German
raiding parties had been repulsed both times without gaining a
foothold. Outdoor quarters selected in the woods were abandoned
after these occurrences, however, for the safety of the
dugouts was thoroughly appreciated, the number of shells falling
into the woods making their use imperative. Wortenko proved
the first casualty of the Company, sustaining a slight injury to
one of his fingers when a shell burst near as he was filling
canteens at the kitchen.</p>

<p>Preparations for the raid executed by the third battalion of
the 101st Infantry Regiment early on the morning of the 30th
northeast of Seicheprey, in the general direction of Richecourt
in the enemy line, included a distracting fire which was furnished
by D Company guns in order to keep the attention of the Boche
from the point to be raided. This barrage started at 2:25 A. M.
and was followed at 2:30 by a concentration of American artillery
fire which paralyzed the enemy batteries for a time. On
an east and west line just to the rear of Beaumont nearly four
regiments of artillery opened fire at the zero hour and aided
by twenty-three machine guns of the Battalion spread a protecting
screen of fire over the raiders.</p>

<p>After the men had returned in safety to our lines with one
prisoner, dubbed "the million dollar kid" because of the expense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
of the undertaking, some of the Hun batteries went into action
and it was 3:35 when an enemy shell struck the emplacement
occupied by Corporal Dowers' squad in the north side of Jury
Woods, killing Jestin McAviney and wounding Bussiere, both of
whom were on duty at the gun.</p>

<p>The following day McAviney was buried in the American
cemetery at Mandres with Chaplain Petty of the 102d Infantry
officiating. He was the only member of the Company to lose
his life during three months of more than ordinary dangers.</p>

<p>Exciting times were in prospect, for according to information
received at Divisional Headquarters, the enemy was massing
troops at Metz, only twenty miles distant, and there was considerable
speculation as to where he would strike, his drive on
the British front having been halted through lack of momentum
and the interposition of new units in that sector by the commander-in-chief
of the Allied armies. Ever since the Toul sector
had become the official American sector early in the year, defensive
preparations had been going on with the building of pill
boxes which would shed most enemy shells as steel helmets shed
hail stones. Reserve trenches protected by wire were prepared
and machine gun positions all along the line in the direction of
Toul put in order for occupancy. Orders were issued concerning
the defense of the sector with the plan of backing up the
troops in front by organized lines which were, in important
places, three miles in depth, carried out in all particulars except
the actual operations.</p>

<p>It was during the excitement of these activities that Company
D was relieved by the machine gun company of the 102d Regiment
and returned to its quarters at La Rehanne on the morning
of June 4, where it was under instructions in the event of a
break through by the enemy to take positions in the forward
edge of the woods and hold off the Hun forces while the troops
in front retreated to cover.</p>

<p>This was a critical period in the history of the war. French
and British were sustaining severe losses, morale was weakening
in the Allies' forces and each day brought news of the unbroken
advance of the Teutons. Appealing to the patriotism of soldiers
which had withstood reverse after reverse for four years, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
few of the crumbs of success, General Petain, commanding the
armies of France, sent out the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The luxuries of baths and new clothing were arranged for
the Company at Menil la Tour, the divisional supply base four
kilometers south of La Rehanne. The following days were
filled with the usual occupations of resting troops,&mdash;baseball
games and concerts at the Y. M. C. A. hut by the 101st Regiment
band. Local talent of all kinds was plentiful and with
the assistance of Johnson and Hine the Salvation Army workers
sold cocoa and doughnuts to lines of men which lasted as long
as the supplies held out.</p>

<p>The dearth of company officers was felt when Lieutenant
Nelson left for the school at Gondrecourt, Lieutenant Carroll
having been previously called to Battalion Headquarters to act
as gas officer.</p>

<p>Moving to the east the battalion sector embraced positions
near the village of Flirey. It was to relieve a French unit in
some of the new territory that the third platoon left on the
night of the 12th. The balance of the Company moved out the
following night to take up positions in the ruins of Seicheprey
and on the ridge just to the southwest of that place, protecting
Beaumont, which place had served successively as a post of
command for the 102d and 101st Infantry Regiments. Passing
safely through the perils of "Dead Man's Curve," the Company
completed the relief under the protection of midnight darkness.</p>

<p>Subject to a heavy share of artillery activity at all times, this
sector proved comparatively quiet until early Sunday morning,
June 16, when the Hun laid down a barrage indicating he was
about to attack. Centering to the left of the Seicheprey positions,
the enemy assault was directed against the village of
Xivray-Marvoisin, held by units of the 103d Infantry Regiment
and D Company, 103d Machine Gun Battalion. The nucleus
of the latter was made up of former members of Troop A.
The efforts of the Germans met such determined resistance that
the lines remained intact and the invaders were hurled from
their slight foothold with severe losses. Artillery fire continued
intermittently during the rest of the day, but good dugouts
afforded shelter for the men.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="Coots" />
</div>


<p>Favored by a fog in the early morning hours of June 19,
the enemy prepared an attack which was to destroy the lines at
Seicheprey and menace the positions in Jury Woods, the key to
a ridge which would have been of military importance to him;
but shortly after his barrage had covered our lines, with his
men concentrated in thick woods covering his first defenses, he
met the full force of the first projector gas attack launched by
the American army. Sixteen hundred projectiles were used in
the operation and they were thrown from a point in front of
Jury Woods. Rage at these tactics was expressed in the terrific
bombardment during the ensuing day of all our forward positions
and communicating areas, but for some reason, supposedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
because of the use of new artillery which had not become
accustomed to the positions, most of the projectiles landed in
places where little harm could be done. Results of the gassing
were apparent from artillery observation posts, which reported
the departure of several hospital trains from stations in the rear
of the German lines. Ackerman and Barry, slightly gassed,
were the only members of the Company to suffer from the fury
of the Hun.</p>

<p>Relief by the French, taking over the sector in conjunction
with the 82d American Division, came on the night of June 25,
when the Company returned to La Rehanne Woods. Continuing
the journey on the 26th, the men hiked twenty-two kilometers
to Lay St. Remy, four kilometers west of Toul, where
barns were assigned as billets and a long sleep was in order
for the morning of the 27th.</p>

<p>Prompted by desire more than by information, the men eagerly
followed the will-o'-the-wisp of a furlough or a short rest at
the least, and arguments occupying the intervals when sight-seeing
through the munitions factories and other points of
interest nearby was not in progress bore heavily on the point
that the Division had seen more than four months of front line
service and was due for a rest. Force of circumstances, however,
refuted this logic, and orders came for the Battalion to
entrain for another part of the front.</p>

<p>Although eager to see new parts of the line, there were signs
of genuine regret among the men when they knew they were
to leave the sector with which they had become so familiar
during the past three months. It had been the scene of their
first real taste of duty as independent units, it held the grave of
the first of their number to give his life, and they had watched
it as the warm of spring days transformed its fields from bleak
vistas of mud to living green dotted with the white and yellow
of the early spring flowers, followed by the period when whole
areas were covered with the brilliant hues of blooming poppies.
Bound for an unknown part of the country, with the probability
of finding most of their previous training discounted by new
conditions, it was only the buoyant spirit characteristic of the
Company throughout the most trying times, which, added to
the thirst for adventure, prevented depression and sent them on
their way singing and whistling.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="small">CHATEAU THIERRY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>By forcing a passage of the Marne east of Chateau Thierry,
the German army had succeeded in cutting the grand line of
France, but in so doing they only delayed troop movements, for
trains could be moved south from the Toul sector, then west
and through the train yards of Paris to their destinations in the
Chateau Thierry region. Following this route the trains passed
through Brienne le Chateau, Troyes, Joinville and other cities
which were fast becoming familiar to the men of the 26th Division
and turned in the freight yards of Noisy le Sec, a suburb
of Paris, to complete their journey by following the Marne
northward through Meaux, the farthest point in the German
advance of 1914, to Lizy sur Ourcq.</p>

<p>Detraining early on the morning of July 1, the Company
marched through Laferte sous Jouarre, where it crossed the
Marne to quarters in a brick yard near Reuil en Brie. Entertained
during their short stay in its suburbs by an air raid on
Paris, and travelling in the direction of the already well-known
Chateau Thierry sector, the men were not at a loss for subjects
for the discussions which always flourished when time was
plentiful. There were games on the 4th, with an impromptu
entertainment in the evening. On the afternoon of the following
day orders were received to move up to the left of the city
of Chateau Thierry and relieve the 2d Division.</p>

<p>Arriving in the woods northwest of Bezu le Guery late at
night, the Battalion rested for two hours and was ordered out
again to return almost to Laferte sous Jouarre, take another
road in the direction of the front, but more to the left of the
position first selected, and make camp near Montreuil aux Lions.
This move was made to form a reserve for the divisions on the
line because of an expected German attack in the vicinity of
Belleau Wood. This failed to materialize and the Battalion
returned to the woods near Bezu le Guery on the night of
July 8. From there A and C Companies relieved machine gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
units of the Second Division occupying the front lines, the third
platoon of D Company going up in support of C Company on
the left of the brigade sector.</p>

<p>On July 10 Lieutenant Nelson and Sergeant Sullivan returned
to the Company from the machine gun school at Gondricourt.</p>

<p>Because the 2d Division was needed to play its part in
another section, it was removed from the support of the 26th,
leaving the Yankees the only obstruction between the armies
of the Crown Prince and their announced goal at Paris. Orders
were issued and the commanders of units on the line distributed
their forces in depth, a defensive arrangement which established
the greater resistance to the enemy at a point some two kilometers
to the rear of the line of contact. This plan included
the use of several batteries of 75 millimeter guns for the purpose
of direct fire at the crests of hills behind which they were located.
A certain number of machine guns were assigned each battery to
aid in its defense. Besides these, other guns were used to cover
certain strategic points on roads and in fields, so that all guns in
the Battalion had been assigned regular positions when the scheme
was completed.</p>

<p>Fighting in this sector had not reached the stage of trench
warfare with which the men had become so familiar during their
stay in the region northwest of Toul. Trenches were nonexistent
except for small rifle pits and a few machine gun
emplacements near the line. Dugouts at their best were nothing
but rude shelters which withstood the rain with difficulty and
were safe only when the Hun was not using his artillery. Men
stationed in or near the villages had the opportunity of using the
houses for sleeping quarters, but those in the many small patches
of woodland found holes in the ground the most reliable resting
places. The hitherto despised pup tent came into use where it
was permitted, and the men made themselves comfortable as
possible, adding to their rations by the confiscation of wandering
flocks of chickens, and itinerant cows furnished milk for more
than one mess.</p>

<p>Entering Vaux on the right of the divisional sector just west
of Chateau Thierry on the night of July 14, the Germans found
it deserted, but when they tried to return to their lines they were
stopped by an intense artillery barrage and the raiding party was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
annihilated by the 101st Infantry Regiment, with but few American
casualties.</p>

<p>For several nights at the request of Colonel Parker of the
102d Infantry, the forward guns of the Company had been used
to lay down barrages of harassing fire on various enemy communicating
paths with good results, according to regimental
observers. With this feature to prevent their stay becoming
monotonous and many new places to explore, the men had not
become discontented with the sector, when, on July 18, at an early
hour in the morning, word was passed down from headquarters
that the Allied offensive was to start at 4:35, shortly after daybreak.
This movement was destined to be the start of the great
offensive which ended in the signing of the armistice terms by
the German powers in November, for at no time after they started
their retreat from the Marne salient on that day, did the German
armies find the strength to halt the onrushing millions of Foch's
men.</p>

<p>It was in the area between Rheims and Soissons that the Crown
Prince had succeeded in breaking through the French defenses
and by this feat advanced to the Marne at Chateau Thierry, a
distance of some twenty miles. The heights about the first two
cities remained impregnable and thus a salient was formed which
was found difficult to hold as soon as pressure was applied by
the Allies.</p>

<p>Preparations for the Allied advance had been going on for
some time and had been carried out with the greatest secrecy,
so when the blow fell the first few days found the Hun unprepared
to make a resistance which could impede the progress of
the French and American troops. From the edge of the salient
west of Soissons the Xth French Army, with the 1st, 2d, and
4th American Divisions occupied the line down to where the
VIth French Army with the 26th American Division was stationed
to the left of Chateau Thierry. On the right of Chateau Thierry
were the 3d and 28th American Divisions operating also under
French command and around the eastern side of the salient
extending northward to Rheims were more French troops with
Italians and Colonials to apply that arm of the pincers to the
imperial forces.</p>

<p>As the 26th Division occupied the curved side of the salient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
extending from Belleau Wood on the left to and including Vaux
on the right, it was forced to wait until the area immediately
to its north was taken by the forces occupying the line from
Soissons, south to Belleau Wood, and for a like reason the 51st
Brigade, holding the right of the divisional sector, was delayed
until the 52d Brigade had reached objectives assigned to clear
the area to the northeast of its positions.</p>

<p>With all units of the Brigade on the front line, those formerly
in reserve to form the first wave of the attack, the order to
advance was received at 3:15 on the afternoon of July 20. D
Company was assigned to the second battalion of the 102d Infantry
and took up a position in the second wave. The victorious
operations of the 103d Infantry on the left were visible to the
men before they made their attack, so they went in at the designated
time with the spirit of victors and the newly fortified
knowledge that as individuals or collectively, the Germans were
no match for them.</p>

<p>Advancing beyond its objectives, the 102d Infantry found that
darkness would leave its flanks exposed, for the 103d had failed
to keep the pace, so the machine guns of the Company were called
to take up defensive positions on the left of the line occupied
by the regiment which had moved for two kilometers in a general
northeasterly direction. Private Russ, wounded in both legs by
shell fire just before the start of the attack, was the first casualty
of the drive. Early the next morning the 103d gained the territory
intervening between its line and that of the 102d, and D
Company, in the first wave of the attack, continued the advance
through shell-splintered woods, piled high with German ammunition
and machine guns, meeting no opposition until noon, when
it became necessary for the first platoon under Lieutenant Paton
to mount its guns and sweep woods where Hun machine gun
nests had halted the progress of the troops. This required but
a short time, for the German gunners were so discomfited by
the fire that they hurriedly withdrew.</p>

<p>Travelling in a northeasterly direction, the Chateau Thierry-Soissons
road was crossed in early afternoon, and although this
was the objective for the day's advance, the march&mdash;for it had
become little else&mdash;was continued to Verdilly, about ten kilometers
north and a little east of Chateau Thierry. The wagon train met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
the Company on the road and relieved the tired gunners of their
loads, for a Hotchkiss machine gun alone weighs sixty-five
pounds, and the feat of carrying one a mile or more belonged
only to the stalwart. All equipment considered excess had been
thrown aside at the start of the advance and packs had been filled
with strips of ammunition. The men were tiring fast under the
strain of their first real battle, but at 6 o'clock the advance was
resumed from Verdilly with the hope that contact with the enemy
might be established by nightfall.</p>

<p>North of Verdilly in the direction of Trugny and Epieds the
country is broken by hills crowned with forests on both sides of
the valley, through which the road leads and the lowlands were
largely filled with wheat fields. Here the German made his first
determined stand and he was aided by the fact that the American
artillery had been unable to keep pace with the advance of the
infantry, so that when American forces pressed close he could
hold his positions with comparative ease against the onslaughts
of infantry defended as they were with countless machine guns.</p>

<p>The bivouac in the woods was made unpleasant for the men by
German artillery, which had taken up positions after a headlong
flight, and a battery of 75's, manned by French, added to the
general din of battle close enough to the sleeping places they had
selected to prevent them from gaining a much needed rest.</p>

<p>Lack of artillery again delayed the attack on the morning of
the 22d, but it was finally decided to attempt it without artillery
preparation and the second section of the second platoon with one
squad of the third under command of Lieutenant Nelson started
the attack, with C Company of the 102d Infantry leaving the
cover of the woods and starting down the slope on the left side
of the Verdilly-Epieds road, Trugny being just to the right of the
Company sector. The Hun, however, had this part of the terrain
well covered with enfilading machine gun and artillery fire from
positions in Trugny Wood on the opposite side of the road, and
the infantry was forced to withdraw, but D Company's men
stayed in the forward positions to cover the doughboys' retreat.
Then attempt after attempt was made to dislodge the enemy but
all efforts failed because he had more bullets than the 102d
Infantry had men. Continuing to hold the positions they had
taken early in the day under the hottest fire they had ever experienced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Corporal Malone's squad all became casualties with the
exception of Coady and Gonsior. Kapitzke and Callahan were
killed in succession as they took up their posts at the gun and the
rest of the men suffered from shell shock and the gas which the
Germans used freely to prevent an advance with the wheat for
cover.</p>

<p>Taking up a flanking position, the first section of the first
platoon succeeded in quieting the most troublesome of the machine
gun nests. After the relief of the men in the line positions was
completed by Lieutenant Paton with the second section of the
first platoon, the order was given for them to retire to the woods
from which they had started their advance, and with the remainder
of the Company to take up the defense of the positions for
the night.</p>

<p>Shelling became very heavy at this interval. Many of the
casualties of the day were suffered by the Company while the
men remained in their positions around the guns during the
barrage of gas and high explosive shells. The total losses of
the Company during the day included Callahan and Kapitzke,
killed; Ed Malone, Farnsworth, Harry O'Neill, Raymond Smith,
Brock, Diamara, and Moses, wounded; Jim Brown, shell-shocked;
Corporal Malone, Oscar Johnson, Lesocke, Kostrzewski, Eddy
and Jacobs, gassed.</p>

<p>The night was spent in mud holes, for there were no trenches
or shelters, but in spite of the rain which fell all night and the
German shells directed against batteries in the rear, whining and
banging all through the hours of darkness, the men slept as only
exhausted men can sleep, and in the morning were rewarded
with an excellent meal from the kitchen, which Lieutenant
Bacharach had manœuvered to Verdilly.</p>

<p>Artillery of all kinds and calibers arrived during the night
and in the morning the 101st Engineers made the attack in place
of the infantry, which had suffered severe casualties and needed
a rest. This served to keep the Boche busy for the day, although
no progress was made until night, when the persistence of the
Engineers and French successes to the north of Epieds forced
the Hun to fall back to Epieds, beyond which point he was driven
by parts of the 102d Infantry and units of the 28th Division,
who took up the attack when he attempted to make a stand in
Trugny.</p>

<p>Passing a large German gun abandoned at the side of the
road near Trugny and many dead Hun machine gunners at their
tiny emplacements along the Verdilly-Epieds road, the Company
marched with carts carrying their guns through Epieds, scarred
by the devices of battle, up the hill to the east and then northeast
again through the woods, shell-splintered and torn, about seven
kilometers, to the Fere en Tardenois road, where the advance
was halted. There the first platoon took up front line positions.</p>

<p>Sleeping in the woods, the remainder of the Company was
treated to a "strafing" by a Hun airman, who used his machine
gun without effect, but during the early morning the artillery
fire which followed resulted in casualties among the members of
the 101st Machine Gun Battalion occupying the same woods.
Relieved by the 42d Division, the Company left the line during
the afternoon of that day, July 25, and hiked to the music of
Eddie O'Neil's fife to shelter in Trugny Woods.</p>

<p>There they slept for the first night in more than a week without
being disturbed by the Hun. Tired, hungry and muddy from a
week of advancing, the men gave proof of their inexhaustible
spirit by singing over a few of the songs they had learned in
training before they rolled up in their blankets for the night.
None of the stories told that night had to do with heroism except
here and there a reference to the invincible quality of their
officers, but rather there was laughter at the incidents which
contained elements of humor. Always the joy of the victor was
uppermost.</p>

<p>Crossing old battlefields, the Battalion marched the following
day to woods just north of Chateau Thierry and there made
preparations for a stay by erecting tents and various forms of
shelter to shed the rain which continued to fall at regular intervals.
Visits to Chateau Thierry began the next day, but the
first men encountered trouble with the Military Police posted
to guard the city. This difficulty was overcome, however, when
the Company appeared in a body and demanded admission.</p>

<p>Spending a part of the following days at drill and cleaning
equipment served as a rest. During this time Lieutenant
Condren, in command of the Company since its first trip to the
line, was ordered to the United States as an instructor and was
given a farewell by the Company. He was succeeded in command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
by Lieutenant Paton, who became a first lieutenant shortly
afterward.</p>

<p>On the 30th the Battalion marched to its old headquarters
at Bezu Woods and then to Chamigny on the Marne River, just
north of Laferte sous Jouarre.</p>

<p>With the entire Battalion billeted in one village and bathing in
the Marne easily accessible, visions of that deferred rest began
to arise. Then came the announcement that all men in the division
were to be allowed a leave of forty-eight hours "outside the
divisional area." With Paris but a scant thirty miles distant,
this meant a visit to the gay French capital, and tales of the
damage being done there by the "Big Berthas" of the Hun did
not impede the rush for passes which followed. Individual
funds were swelled by pay for June, which soon came. Added
to this was about thirty francs distributed to each man from
funds raised for the purpose by the Spanish War Veterans of
Connecticut. Thereafter all popular stories were introduced by
the phrase "when I was in Paris."</p>

<p>Orders to leave for home had been received by Sergeants
McCarthy and McLoughlin, the latter leaving on the first day
of the advance just ended. Private Foster was transferred to
the headquarters detachment of the 1st American Army which
was being formed for the attack at St. Mihiel, and Lieutenant
Dolan, who had been with the Company since he was assigned
as instructor at Certilleux, was sent to the divisional military
police headquarters. Captain H. P. Sheldon was assigned to
command the Company.</p>

<p>Athletic events occupied part of the time in Chamigny and
Johnson qualified for the finals in the divisional meet at Saacy,
scoring the only point for the Battalion there by placing fourth
in the 440 yard race. Evenings were filled with entertainments
at the "Y" hut and trips to La Ferte. Correspondence was heavy
until orders were again received to move, this time after a short
period of intensive training not far from the vicinity of the Toul
sector the men had come to know so well, where the Division
became a part of the 1st Army in the first purely American
offensive.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="small">ST. MIHIEL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Leaving Chamigny August 14, the Battalion hiked to Lizy sur
Ourcq, where it entrained the following morning, travelling in
a general southeasterly direction to Poincon, near Chatillon sur
Seine in the department of Cote D'Or, from which a hike of
twenty-two kilometers ended the journey at Massigny late on
the night of the 16th. Billets were assigned and preparations
again made for a long stay, but the furloughs authorized in
divisional orders failed to materialize before instructions were
issued for the movement to the St. Mihiel front.</p>

<p>During the brief stay in Massigny, however, training was
taken up intensively. Officers and non-commissioned officers
attended schools both with the Battalion and at Chatillon, where
the Second Corps school on automatic weapons had been established.
On the 18th Lieutenant Bacharach was ordered home
as an instructor and Lieutenant Nelson received a well-earned
advance in rank to first lieutenant and was ordered to Battalion
Headquarters as advance observation officer. Lieutenant Carroll,
who had served with Battalion Headquarters as Gas and Intelligence
Officer, was returned to the Company. Captain Sheldon
was ordered to duty as liaison officer with the 102d Infantry,
taking command of C and D Companies under the plan used
in action whereby the two senior officers in the Battalion acted
with the commanders of the two infantry regiments in the brigade
to coördinate the work of machine gunners and infantry.</p>

<p>In spite of the casualties the Company had suffered and the
number of men it had lost through transfers, but few replacements
had been received. With but three officers in the command,
one of whom had been but recently attached, Lieutenant
Paton was authorized to appoint three sergeants as acting lieutenants.
Curtiss, Rogers and A. H. Viebranz were selected and
Tom Reilly was again added to the roster after an absence of
four months, most of which he had spent at home in the interests
of the Third Liberty Loan campaign.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>Moving out on the morning of August 29, the Company accomplished
the journey to Latrecey, the entraining point, in two days,
and bivouacked there until the morning of the following day,
because a derailed engine prevented train movements. After
riding all day toward the north, the trains were unloaded at
Nancois-Trouville in the department of the Meuse. It was during
this trip that "Ted" Lewis, cited for gallant work during the
advance from the Marne, fell from the train and was severely
injured.</p>

<p>Hiking to Longville, about seven kilometers distant, shelter
tents were pitched and mess served. The march was again taken
up after a two hour rest and the Battalion hiked ten kilometers
in a typical French drizzle to shelter in the Bois Jenvoi on the
right of the road to Erize. With orders to make all movements
at night and keep in the shelter of woods during the day, the
Battalion marched during the night of September 1 to woods on
the road between Courouvre and Neuville en Verdunnois, where
it camped until the fifth. Twenty-nine men were received from
replacement camps at this place.</p>

<p>Two more days of hiking took the men to barracks at Camp
Nivolette in the Ravin de la Vignotte, northeast of Rupt en
Wœvre, about six kilometers from the "line" in the heights of
the Meuse on the western side of the St. Mihiel salient. French
soldiers, always well informed concerning impending movements,
told of "beaucoup, beaucoup" artillery being put into position
every night. Thus the fact became generally known that the
Division was to take an active part in driving the Hun from the
salient he made in 1914 when he attempted to isolate the fortress
of Verdun, force him to abandon the great defensive works he
had erected during his four years' occupation of the line in that
region and crush his forces in a turning movement which would
prevent their withdrawal.</p>

<p>Assembling the Battalion Sunday morning, September 8, Major
Murphy read the orders from Divisional Headquarters citing
many of the officers and men for their work during the Chateau
Thierry offensive. Dr. Johnson, the Battalion's Y. M. C. A. secretary,
read President Wilson's Fourth of July speech and gave a
short address. The men sang the first verse of "America" and
the services were concluded with the Lord's Prayer.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>Officers and section leaders of the Company reconnoitered
during the following day the ground over which the advance was
to be made. Orders were issued for the 51st Brigade to advance
through the Ravin de France along the Rue des Feuilles to the
Grand Tranchee de Calonne road in a southeasterly direction
parallel to the road, the left flank keeping in touch with it at all
times, for the Grand Tranchee was named as the axis of liaison
with the 52d Brigade, which was to advance along its left side.
The objective of the first day was designated as the Rue de Vaux.</p>

<p>After a seven hour bombardment by a volume of artillery
without rival in American operations up to that time, the advance
began, A and B Companies of the Battalion in the first wave
while C and D remained in reserve, proceeding leisurely with
guns loaded on the carts. Arriving at Moyilly on the American
side of the old line, the column was halted for three hours while
the 101st Engineers repaired as best they could the damage shell
fire had done to the Rue des Feuilles. Almost obliterated, the
route of the Company was blocked by barbed wire, shell holes
and destroyed trenches, but in a comparatively short time the
path was cleared and the advance proceeded to a point where
the rolling barrage following the first concentration of fire had
stopped and then travelling was easy.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Grand Tranchee without mishap with all the
area cleared of enemy troops, the Companies continued along
that road in column formation and were only halted when
machine guns located along the Rue de Vaux began to endanger
the leading units in the advance. A few well-directed shots from
mortars silenced these and the infantry added the personnel and
officers serving the guns to the total it had bagged during the
day.</p>

<p>This cleared the day's objectives but the desire was strong
with those in command to gain contact with the rear guard of
the fleeing Huns before they could organize defensive positions,
so the advance continued through the night along the Grand
Tranchee road, on both sides of which could be seen the cabins
and gardens established by the Germans during their stay in the
sector. Hiking on through the woods more than one man complained
of "this man's war" not being nearly as interesting as
the one at Chateau Thierry. When at last the cover of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
woods was left, before them, all along the skyline could be seen
the flames from burning villages, the funeral pyres of the hopes
the German high command had entertained early in the war of
going direct to Paris from Metz.</p>

<p>Crossing the plateau on which it emerged, the Company entered
the village of Hattonchatel, located on the edge of the table land,
beyond which they could see villages in flames all through the
valley. Descending a long, winding road into the lowland, guns
were taken from the carts in preparation for action, as it was
reported the enemy was making a stand in Vigneulles, a short
distance ahead. Proving to be members of a military band left
behind by the retreating Germans to destroy the town, the men
and officers were captured without effort or casualties. Then
the Company slept for the night after hiking during the greater
part of the preceding twenty-four hours and helping to attain
an objective which had been thought beyond the range of possibilities.</p>

<p>There was no rest for the second platoon, however, for with
Lieutenant Paton in command, that group of men was taken
toward the south with I Company of the 102d Infantry to the
village of Creue, where it was rumored Hun artillery was
stationed. Fifty-one men and three officers were taken prisoners
in this manœuver, and the men in the raiding party were rewarded
with a rich supply of souvenirs. Mess the next day was served
to the Company in Vigneulles, supplemented by a supply of beer
the Huns had been forced to abandon. The town was a rich
field for sightseers with its theater and other appurtenances
provided in rest camps, as it was the recreation center for the
sector.</p>

<p>A "whizz-bang" (Austrian 88 millimeter field piece) left behind
at a sacrifice post by the retreating army entertained during the
next day, but was silenced by a party of infantrymen. Bombs
were distributed about the town by a Hun airplane during mess
time but failed to produce casualties.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Battalion marched out to Longeau Farm
by way of Hattonchatel, a German divisional headquarters, a
trip more interesting because the men could see for the first time
the north side of the stronghold of Montsec, the south side of
which had loomed up before American troops during their occupation
of the Toul sector with a forbidding appearance.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>The first platoon took positions in the town of Hannonville-sous-les-Cotes
during the night of the 14th and the following
day the Company marched on a short distance north to Herbeuville
with the first platoon moving out on the plains of the Wœvre
to Wadonville. Lieutenant Nelson, who had finished his duties
as advance observation officer with Battalion Headquarters, was
returned to the Company on the 21st. That night, with a part
of the second platoon, he relieved guns of C Company, 103d
Machine Gun Battalion, stationed in Saulx, slightly to the north
of the rest of the Company.</p>

<p>With preparations for the American operations about to start
in the Argonne practically complete, it was ordered that divisions
occupying the line resulting from the reduction of the St. Mihiel
salient start enough activity on their front to prevent the Hun
moving his divisions to the more threatened parts of the line.
One of the first of these actions was conducted on the night of
September 22, when part of the 101st Infantry, with B Company
of the Battalion, raided the enemy lines. They succeeded in
taking thirteen prisoners and drawing an intense artillery bombardment
over the entire divisional sector. On the 25th the first
battalion of the 102d Infantry with A Company of the Battalion
attacked and took the village of Marcheville as part of a concerted
movement all along the line in one of the costliest engagements
of the drive. It was during this operation that Private
Richard Butler, acting as a runner for Captain Humbird, accompanied
that fearless soldier as a volunteer on an expedition to
silence a pill-box which had been causing trouble. He received
a mortal wound while disarming prisoners after the task had been
successfully completed.</p>

<p>As the attempted advance was a diversion to keep the enemy
troops occupied on that front, troops in Marcheville were withdrawn
when the Germans counter attacked, for that was the
original plan. Taking place on the day the drive started north
of Verdun, this action was considered in official records as a
part of the Meuse-Argonne battle which ended the war.</p>

<p>Line officers and men had to die or court death, in order to
receive special commendation, at the same time producing beneficial
results to the troops in action, but a premium was set on
the bravery and coolness of staff officers during this operation
when distinguished service crosses were awarded to several who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
were caught in an enveloping wave of the enemy at a point they
considered safe, and who endured, without giving way to their
emotions, a barrage which was the ordinary portion of the fighters.</p>

<p>Relieved by the machine gun company of the 102d Infantry
on the night of September 28, the Company marched through
the ever-present mud and water to take up reserve positions in
the woods back of Herbeuville. Quarters here were unsatisfactory
but afforded some rest for men who had seen too much
of the line during the past eight months. Constant duty under
shell fire always dangerous, if not severe, had begun to show its
effects in the faces and bearing of the men, but they kept up an
unbeatable morale, singing and whistling on the march and seeing
always the element of humor which lurked in odd corners for
those with the ability to view events from the right angle.</p>

<p>An announcement made at this time through the <i>Stars and
Stripes</i> gave the information that any organization could become
the foster parent of a French orphan by depositing five hundred
francs with the Red Cross. This brought a quick response and
Company D was soon listed as one of the A. E. F. units to take
a share in this enterprise.</p>

<p>Upon occasion the Hun would send over a few gas shells in
the hope of getting the unwary in the vicinity of the Company's
quarters, but his efforts proved unfruitful and most of the remaining
days in that sector were comparatively quiet.</p>

<p>Inured to the effects of rumors the men scoffed at reports
of impending peace, and the news that Bulgaria had surrendered
was received with little enthusiasm. The report early in October
that Austria-Hungary had given Germany a day in which to
accept the Allied peace terms was barely noticed by the men.
Constant attention to the details of waging the war had a tendency
to confine the soldier's outlook on the prospects of peace
to his own immediate world and such an outlook only emphasized
in his mind what a huge task it was, producing a certain
doggedness to see it through, endless as it seemed. On the contrary,
folks at home were able to grasp the end toward which
all the operations were moving and the great successes which General
Foch's tactics were bringing strengthened in their minds the
idea of an early peace.</p>

<p>Relieved by a unit of the divisional machine gun battalion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the 79th Division during the night of October 7, the Company
hiked to Vaux, where the men found that B Company had preceded
them by a short time and had taken possession of all
available shelter, so D Company disposed itself for sleeping in
the open in the customary rain of moving days.</p>

<p>Deluded too many times to think that furloughs might be in
sight, there was little comment on hopes for a rest and it was no
surprise to the men when the hike which started at 5 o'clock
on the afternoon of October 8 headed the Company northward
in the general direction of the area where the fiercest fighting
of the war was taking place,&mdash;the Argonne Forest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="small">NORTH OF VERDUN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Stopping for a day in Ancemont west of the Meuse River for
improvised baths and haircuts by the Company barbers refreshed
the men, although clean clothes were not to be had. The night
of October 9 the Battalion took up quarters in the Caserne de
Bevaux, a large cavalry barracks just a kilometer east of the
famous fortress of Verdun. Paris had its charms for the American
soldier, but he looked with more favor upon the arts of
war, worshipped more at that time before the shrines of military
greatness than the creations of great architects and sculptors, so
the world-famed ruins of Verdun were attacked with a full-hearted
avidity which carried the men to its most remote passages.
From the parapets of its outer defenses to the recesses of its
great tunnels they walked and marvelled that a city could withstand
artillery bombardment of such intensity for so long without
being crumbled to a heap of dust. Verdun was the point of a
terrific attack which lasted for months, in the defense of which
tens of thousands of French soldiers had made their last stand
and before which Huns in far greater numbers had given their
lives blindly for a hopeless cause.</p>

<p>For six days the Company stayed in the barracks, repairing
equipment and getting into shape for the coming period of
activity, the severity of which was foretold by units which had
been relieved. Austrian prisoners sent back from the line spoke
only of peace, giving as their belief that the war was fast coming
to a close, but the many varieties of rumors were put aside on
the night of the 15th, when the Company moved north through
the outer defenses of Verdun, through Belleville and Bras to
the Ravin d'Andremont, not far from Samogneaux, a little
village about twelve kilometers north of Verdun east of the
Meuse River.</p>

<p>All signs of shelter had been demolished here and the men
slept in the open while the inevitable rain of a hiking day soaked
their clothes and blankets. The following morning brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
visions of what shell fire had done to much of the artillery and
wagon trains which had started for the line. Although the latest
advances had made it practically safe for troops and it was now
used for a camping place for all branches of line troops, at one
time not far passed Hun artillery had accounted for large numbers
of American horses and mules, whose dead bodies were lying all
around the area.</p>

<p>Ordered to relieve machine gunners of the 29th American
Division and certain French troops, the Company began its march
to the new positions that night, only locating the sector assigned
to it after a six hour hike during which colorful compliments
were paid the guides who had been assigned from the relieved
units to lead the way. Loaded with packs, guns and ammunition
and further handicapped by the hilly character of the country,
the men struggled through shell holes, occasional bits of barbed
wire, underbrush and fallen trees and mud, always mud, to the
positions in the Bois d'Ormont which they reached just before
dawn.</p>

<p>The Bois d'Ormont is a small elliptical-shaped woodland on the
crest of one of the many hills in that region and the American
and German lines were within a few yards of each other, near
the center of the woods. Members of the Company with ability
to converse with the Huns, made several trips to the German
lines and tried to induce them to return as prisoners, but the
minions of Prussianism were strong in their belief that the war
was shortly coming to an early end and decided they could better
afford to take the chance for the rest of the time than enter a
prison camp for an indefinite period. They told of changes in
the government of the Fatherland, the abdication of the Kaiser
and other rumors afterward fulfilled.</p>

<p>October 20 a short American barrage brought an immediate
response from the nervous Teutons and they laid a box barrage
around the sector occupied by the Division, evidently believing
an attack was coming. Until the 23d the lines were at a standstill.
On several occasions it was rumored that an attack was to be
made by the enemy or Allied troops, but all that broke the monotony
of the days was the Hun practice of shelling ration parties.</p>

<p>With the infantry battalions, especially those of the 102d Regiment,
depleted by the enormous losses they had incurred in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
previous action, the Division was holding a rather narrow sector.
Officers were lacking in most of the companies and the men were
holding on through sheer nerve, short of rations, clothing,
blankets and all the creature comforts obtainable in parts of the
line they had formerly occupied. It was in this condition they
were ordered to take the aggressive October 23. On the left of
the Company's positions parts of the 102d and 101st Infantry
regiments succeeded in straightening out a section of the line
which threatened to prove a favorable position for a flanking
attack by the enemy. This manœuver was completed with the
aid of the artillery and machine guns.</p>

<p>The following day after preparation to resist an attack in the
morning, orders were issued in the afternoon to clear the woods
of Germans, and this task was attempted by L and M Companies
of the 102d Infantry with D Company furnishing the machine
guns. Without artillery preparation the men went forward,
fighting through the tangled woods against an enemy entrenched,
armed with innumerable machine guns and numerically superior,
but lack of leaders and proper liaison with the units on their
flanks forced them to return after they had almost gained their
objective. Again on the morning of October 25 orders were
issued to attempt the advance, but it again proved too much for
the men.</p>

<p>With entire battalions formed into units, but slightly greater
in size than a full infantry company and the men suffering from
the exertion of the past few days and lack of sleep, a final attempt
was made Sunday, October 27, to force the enemy from his positions
in the woods which had a certain strategical importance in
the military situation. As the barrage was scheduled to start
at 10 o'clock that morning, all men were withdrawn from the
front lines and held in readiness to attack when the curtain of
fire thrown over by the artillery should lift enough at 11 o'clock
to allow them to go forward.</p>

<p>Summoned to Battalion Headquarters, Lieutenant Paton left
his post of command after the barrage was well under way and
started down a communicating trench accompanied by Nutting.
German artillery had started its reply and was doing all it could
to prevent the attack which the Huns knew to be in preparation,
and a life which had seemed charmed was taken as toll when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Lieutenant Paton was killed by a fragment from a bursting shell.
Wilfore and Lieutenant Pickett of the Infantry were mortal
victims of the same messenger of death and Nutting suffered
dozens of wounds from the small bits of steel which fill the air
close to an exploding projectile.</p>

<p>Time after time under the leadership of non-commissioned
officers from their own companies and several of the D Company
sergeants the infantry went out onto that short stretch of ground
separating them from the coveted German trenches, but each time
they fell back, hundreds of casualties resulting from the perfect
hail of machine gun bullets which the Germans sprayed across
that section of "No Man's Land." In the command of a second
lieutenant the third battalion of the 102d Infantry mustered one
hundred and eighty men that night, practically one fifth of its
authorized strength, while D Company had lost seventeen during
the day from its already depleted personnel. A reorganization
of the defenses of the sector was effected the next day, and three
surplus guns were sent to the rear, the strength of the Company
being too low to provide crews for them.</p>

<p>A little to the rear of the lines the bodies of Lieutenant Paton,
Wilfore and Rosenkind were buried by the men and services at
the graves were conducted at three o'clock on the afternoon of
October 29 by Chaplain Creighton of the 101st Field Signal
Battalion. Disheartened, as the men were, by the loss of their
comrades and officer, this sorrow came at a time when their spirits
were at a very low ebb. All about them in the line were the
bodies of French, American and German dead, rude cemeteries
were filled on every side and the fever of battle against overwhelming
odds had begun to dull their senses to the finer emotions
they would have experienced under different conditions.</p>

<p>Where such a large proportion of the men have the qualities
of heroes a life is risked or given as a matter of completing the
task in hand, so it is not strange that in spite of all the Company
went through during this unequalled campaign but two were
especially rewarded. George Eddy received the Croix de Guerre
for work in destroying a machine gun crew which threatened
the flank of the advancing infantry, and Mike Yuczszik was
awarded both the Belgian and French war crosses for presence
of mind in dropping the tripod he carried onto a Hun "potato-masher"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
grenade thrown into a shell hole occupied by his squad
during an attack.</p>

<p>While carrying messages from Battalion Headquarters Bill
Meickle was reported missing during the action of October 25.
His name was added to the list of honored dead when it was
found later that he had died in the hospital from wounds received
in the performance of his duty.</p>

<p>Cited for gallantry during the Chateau Thierry drive, Sergeant
C. Lyon Rogers had been recommended for a commission as
second lieutenant and he was sworn in as an officer on October
28 after performing the duties of one for more than a month.</p>

<p>Relief by D Company, 103d Machine Gun Battalion was completed
early on the morning of October 30, and the Company
withdrew to a hillside south of Ormont Farm where it spent the
day, and the following night moved to the place at the crossroads
it had occupied before entering the line. Long range
shelling of this position made rest impossible. Twelve mules
were killed and seven wounded when a Hun projectile landed
in the picket line, but Geer was the only man to suffer injury
from the succeeding shells as the Company sought places nearer
the top of the hill for safety.</p>

<p>Under way again, the Company relieved a group of French
machine gunners on November 1 in the Bois des Caures, a kilometer
northwest of Beaumont and slightly to the right of the
positions occupied by it in the Ormont Woods. This was reputed
to be a quiet sector and so it proved with the exception of occasional
shelling when ration parties were due. One of these
salvoes delivered against Lieutenant Nelson's post of command
resulted in the wounding of Oscar Johnson and Bill Kennedy,
the latter mortally. Kennedy had volunteered to aid in the distribution
of rations and was struck at a time when his ordinary
duties would have kept him out of danger.</p>

<p>Armistice rumors were numerous and convincing, but the invitation
sent over by the Huns to become prisoners and end the
fighting found no sympathy in the American lines. Many of the
men were being sent to the hospital, suffering from gas, shell-shock
and illness, but the largest percentage of these came from
the replacements, who, although they had come to the Company
fresh from training, failed to stand the rigors of the campaign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
as well as the men who had fought through nine months without
rest.</p>

<p>Infantry raiding parties sent out to identify the German units
in the line met with small success, but three prisoners they brought
back were confident that the war would end within a few days
as were all the French with whom the men came in contact.
More reliance was placed in the reports from the latter, for the
French soldier was always well informed as to probable events.</p>

<p>Meeting but weak resistance the infantry cleared the woods of
Germans November 8, and it was during this operation that
Lieutenant Rogers was killed by a machine gun bullet. He was
in charge of two machine guns in the advance but had been
asked to lead a party of infantry over the top and while organizing
the men he met his death. His fearlessness had placed
him as high in the esteem of neighboring units as it had in that
of his own men. It was one of the doughboys who remarked
that "he shouldn't have been a second lieutenant, but an infantry
captain."</p>

<p>Advancing down the road in the direction of Ville devant
Chaumont with the third battalion of the 102d Infantry, it was
found that units on the right and left flanks had failed to keep
up with the movement, so after consolidating the position, the
men remained there during the night of the 8th and were withdrawn
a half kilometer in the morning. The advance was taken
up later in the day and continued through to the eastern edge
of Champneuville woods, in the conquest of which Corporal
Arthur Parmalee was wounded so severely he died that day.</p>

<p>The entire Battalion took up the march eastward on the 10th
in support of the infantry. That night the doughboys were sent
into Wavrille Woods to protect the flank of the advance. They
were shelled heavily, but German dugouts and shell-proofs were
as effective against Hun shell-fire as they had been against
American bombardments, so the men rested comfortably until
the next morning, when they were marched back to Beaumont,
from which place, with the remnants of the third battalion of
the 102d Infantry, they were ordered into the line to relieve the
101st Infantry. Reports had gained circulation that hostilities
were to cease at 11 o'clock, but little credence was given them.</p>

<p>Orders were given out to begin the attack at 10:39 ceasing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
advance at 11:00, but it was 11:03 before the formations were
perfected and the men ready to start after the enemy. Three
minutes before this the artillery fire which had been practically
continuous for days and had reached its greatest intensity in this
region not long before the final hour suddenly ceased and an
almost uncanny silence prevailed. Far from being hailed by the
men as the hour for which they had struggled through seemingly
endless days, it was greeted silently. Neither American nor
enemy soldiers exhibited joy when they knew hostilities were at
an end, but, under the spell of a war, which had been the most
exciting, most terrible thing within the span of their lives, they
awaited the realization of peace.</p>

<p>Keeping well out of sight during the daylight hours the Huns
gave an indication of their feelings at night by providing a pyrotechnical
display which vied with a July 4 celebration in brilliance.
Rockets, verrey lights and flares were used in profusion, but
there was no intercourse between D Company and its enemies,
for early that night heavy, unbroken sleep was the portion of all
except a few infantrymen who were used in establishing an outpost
as a guard against possibilities and the last night on the line
was spent in that prosaic but profitable manner.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="small">AFTER THE ARMISTICE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>To the world behind the lines the conclusion of an armistice
meant the end of the Great War, a quick return to peace time
conditions and the resumption of normal business. Armistice
day was celebrated throughout the nations included in the Allied
list. Crowds everywhere were wild with joy. But the man who
had been on the line for months, facing death or wounds nearly
every day for a seemingly endless time, was dazed rather than
joyful when the cannon and machine gun were silenced and the
menace of the Hun airplane bomb passed into history.</p>

<p>The strain of the last few weeks at the front was of that
terribly tense variety which cannot be shaken off. Strong in
nerve and inured to hardships as the Company was, the incessant
turmoil of the latter part of October proved too nerve-racking
for a large number of men and they were ordered back
to the hospitals just before the armistice. Casualties of the
Company during all the fighting totaled eighty-six. Two thirds
of these were caused within the last three weeks of the War.</p>

<p>Thirty-two members of the Company were in positions on the
line at 11 o'clock on November 11, 1918, and twenty-five of these
were of the original personnel which left Niantic. Four fifths
of the number usually assigned to gun squads were gone.</p>

<p>When the relief by units of the 4th Division was complete at
noon, November 12th, the Company left behind it the bloody
fields of the Argonne-Meuse battle and began its long hike to
the south. The trip was made in easy stages. Passing down
through the valley of the Meuse the route followed took the
Battalion to the Ninth Training Area, southwest of Neufchateau,
and November 23 billets were assigned in the village of Poulangy,
fifteen kilometers north of Chaumont, in Haute Marne.</p>

<p>Reports circulated that the 26th Division would take its place
as a unit of the Army of Occupation and all units shortly
embarked on a program of training, the purpose of which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
discipline. Close order drill took a prominent place in the schedule
and this was relieved by machine gun work and manœuvers.</p>

<p>Replacements were added to the Company on the trip back
from the lines and many of those sent to the hospital returned
in small groups or singly as the days passed. Intricacies of red
tape failed to stop D Company men from waiting for the first
dark night and eluding the hospital sentries so they could take
the shortest route back to their friends. Many and varied were
the stories of foiled M. P.'s and puzzled officers who tried to
trace the runaways.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving was made notable only through the efforts of
Sergeant Foley, who purchased supplies at the commissary to
add to the meager rations. No turkey adorned the tables of
the mess hall that day, for the American Expeditionary Forces
had increased in number from the bare hundred thousand of the
previous year to more than two million men.</p>

<p>Rain and snow made the mud deeper than ever for the weeks
which followed and the drill schedule was carried out with difficulty.
Inspections took place with the customary frequency,
baths and delousing operations with issues of new clothing bringing
the appearance of the command up to the point of perfection
it had reached before entering the line.</p>

<p>Although the order authorizing all units in the Division to
wear the identifying "YD" on the upper left sleeve was issued
in August, it was not found possible to comply with the regulation
until late in December. Then the soldiers appeared with
the blue felt emblem which distinguished them as members of
the Yankee Division. Furlough orders were plentiful and the
ranks of the Company were constantly being thinned by the
departure of a large percentage of the men to the vacation areas
in the south of France.</p>

<p>President Wilson, attending the peace conference in Paris,
found time to review the 26th Division on Christmas Day on the
parade grounds near Chaumont. For this event only part of
the Division was assigned to participate and the 102d Machine
Gun Battalion was chosen to represent the machine gunners of
the Yankees.</p>

<p>December 24th the Battalion hiked to a small town within a
few kilometers of the parade ground and billeted there over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
night. Christmas Day was raw and disagreeable and winter
mud prevented the artillery units taking part in the review. D
Company led the Battalion past the reviewing stand and finished
the hike back to Poulangy that night.</p>

<p>Christmas festivities among the men and officers were in order
for the following day. Drills were suspended and the miniature
boxes allowed to pass through the mails from home were delivered
to the Company. That night Sergeant Foley again proved
his worth by producing a feed reminiscent of the annual holiday
feast at home. Seated in the mess hall with the enjoyable odors
from the steaming dinner sharpening their desire to attack their
full mess kits, the men refused to eat until Lieutenant Nelson
came to the hall. They cheered their commander with an enthusiasm
founded on a whole-hearted admiration for him as man
and soldier. After mess he was presented with funds to purchase
a trench coat and boots in the name of the Company, and
a regulation D Company entertainment was provided to conclude
the celebration.</p>

<p>In order that the Battalion might be in a better position to
take part in the manœuvers constituting a part of the program
of training, it was moved east about fifteen kilometers to the
village of Esnouveaux on January 2. Here news was received
that the Division was no longer considered a part of the Army
of Occupation and the football season was inaugurated.</p>

<p>In the first game D Company defeated C Company of the
Battalion 12 to 0 and February 13 concluded its conquest of
Battalion teams by trimming B Company 34 to 0 on the gridiron
at Mansigne, in the Le Mans area. February 16 the 103d Artillery
eleven held the Battalion team, composed of D Company
men with substitutes from the other teams in the Battalion, to
a scoreless tie. The team representing the 103d Machine Gun
Battalion was the next to fall before the prowess of Captain
"Duke" Rowley and his men. They lost 7 to 0. Then the 101st
Engineers, with their team of college stars, tasted defeat in a
score of 18 to 0 on March 5th. The 101st Artillery followed
in the path of their predecessors and dropped a 7 to 0 game to
the fighting machine gunners on March 7, and March 12 the
schedule was completed when the 101st Infantry played a scoreless
tie with the team.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>This feat entitled the winners to the divisional championship
and each of the men received the medal emblematic of their
victory. From the first game feeling ran high through the
Division, arguments were numerous on the sidelines and large
numbers of francs changed hands after each contest.</p>

<p>A highly successful minstrel troupe was organized among the
members of the Company. Their performances were featured
with the parodies written by Otis Culver, who was the leading
spirit in the movement. This show was so well received that
it was chosen to take a trip through the various units of the
Division and was about to start on a short tour when orders
were received for the Battalion to entrain for the port of embarkation
at Brest.</p>

<p>With the establishment of educational centers throughout the
American Expeditionary Forces by the army in coöperation with
welfare workers, the men were given the opportunity of selecting
courses of study they wished to pursue and were sent to the
different schools for a period of four months. Corporals
Watrous and Harrington and Bugler Shaw went from the
enlisted men of the Company and Lieutenant Nelson also decided
to follow his studies for the designated period.</p>

<p>In line for drill on the morning of March 3, the Company
awaited a word of farewell from Lieutenant Nelson, the only
officer who had been with them through their entire service, but
he was so overcome by emotion his only words were, "I can't
say what I want to say. You'll find it on the bulletin board.
Good-bye." The speech he had prepared in anticipation of the
event was displayed until all the men had read it.</p>

<p>Captain Brouse and Lieutenant Carroll remained with the
Company until the former was also detailed to attend school.
Then Lieutenant Carroll assumed the herculean task of keeping
many of the D Company men from serving sentences of various
lengths for misdemeanors, at no time serious, but always provoking
to the higher officers, for the old Troop A spirit of taking
things into their own hands whenever they saw fit was still strong.</p>

<p>Day after day the Company was subjected to the delousing
processes brought into use during the war, and inspections of
all kinds followed each other in endless procession. Clothing,
equipment and billets were inspected until the men were staying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
up after taps to be certain that everything was in the proper
order. The climax to these occurrences was the field inspection
by officers from General Headquarters.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="caption">
    <span class="xsmall">IF THE COMPANY MEMBERS COULD DISTRIBUTE MEDALS</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Billeted in a magnificent chateau near the village of Mansigne,
the men occupied the best quarters they had found in France.
In addition to the comforts of a fireplace in nearly every room,
a piano was found and permission obtained for its use. This
improvement in the entertainment facilities of the town was
utilized during all spare hours.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>March 29 orders were received for the Battalion to entrain
for Brest and the men were crowded into box cars so closely
that none could sleep during the long ride which followed.
Arriving at Brest the following morning they hiked to Pontanezen
Camp and were introduced to the system employed at that
place for caring for thousands of transient troops. The tents
were fitted with floors and iron beds were provided for a
majority of the men. They were fed in long lines at several
kitchens and the mess proved excellent.</p>

<p>After receiving candy and other articles from the Red Cross,
the Company embarked on the <i>Patricia</i>, formerly the German
steamer <i>Hamburg</i>, on the afternoon of April 6, finally to start
on the journey about which rumors had been spread so many
times. A solemn silence was maintained the first night on board
ship, for stories had gained circulation during the stay in the
Brest camp that units had been returned to shore after embarking
for the slightest breach of military etiquette. Once safely on
the ocean, with the shores of France receding on the horizon,
they were willing to again take up their favorite amusements
and help make the trip as pleasant as possible.</p>

<p>There were a few days when the unfortunate ones among the
passengers were attacked by seasickness, but the first day of this
trouble usually meant that the next rough seas could be passed
successfully.</p>

<p>When six hundred miles from Boston a former German officer
attempted to set fire to the ship, but was apprehended before
much damage resulted and placed under arrest for the remainder
of the trip.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 17, was a red letter day on the calendar for
all the men on the <i>Patricia</i>, for while going to mess that morning
they had their first sight of the United States in more than
eighteen months. At noon the ship passed Boston light, and
shortly afterward the fleet of welcoming boats made its appearance.
These were received in silence in spite of the enthusiasm
of the welcomers until Major General Edwards made his appearance
on one of them; then the flood of feeling was loosed and
the veteran commander of the Yankee Division received an
ovation which resounded over the waters of Boston harbor.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>Landing at the immense pier the army had taken over for
transport use, the men were met by the welcoming committee
from New Haven, headed by Captain Wolf and Captain Condren.
Here they were the recipients of more chocolate, cigarettes,
candy, cigars and cakes than they could use and after a short
period while the public was allowed on the pier, they loaded
their baggage onto a waiting train and continued their trip to
Camp Devens, Ayer, Mass.</p>

<p>The next day passes were granted to some of the men for
two-day leaves at home, and the rest of the Company took the
opportunity to leave without passes, for home had been far away
too long to allow such a chance to pass by. Proud relatives and
friends met the train at the New Haven station and the returned
soldiers were fêted to the limit for the time they had to spend
at home.</p>

<p>April 25 the 26th Division was received officially at Boston.
A parade of several miles through the center of the city between
solid walls of cheering New Englanders was the feature of the
day and at night the Boston companies were entertained by their
friends while D Company men wandered around the city until
it was time for them to return to their billet in Horticultural Hall.</p>

<p>Returning to Devens the next day the men were quartered in
the barracks which had housed the 76th Division while it trained
in that camp. Monday, April 28, Lieutenant Carroll, in command
of the Company, was presented with a watch and chain
as a remembrance of the esteem in which he was held by the men.</p>

<p>The last two days at the big camp were filled with important
work,&mdash;service records must be prepared and correctly endorsed,
discharge papers filled out and final returns made of all government
property. This was all completed and at last on the
morning of April 29 final pay with transportation home was
given to the waiting line of men. It was an event toward which
many anxious thoughts had been turned for months. It meant
for most of the men the termination of their first period as
soldiers and it completed the roll of experience which had been
filled to the last detail for the original members of the company
who were fortunate enough to complete the tour of duty.</p>

<p>With the issuance of discharge papers, Company D, 102d
Machine Gun Battalion passed into history, as had Troop A,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Cavalry, Connecticut National Guard, and "The Second Company
of Governor's Horse Guards."</p>

<p>Returning to New Haven the men were dined by the city after
a parade in the latter part of May and were brought together
early in June for an afternoon of celebration by the veterans
of Troop A.</p>

<p>As the dauntless spirit of bravery and endurance welded so
firmly in the heat of battle is emblazoned on the rolls of history
in the names of those who dwell beneath "the crosses row on
row," may it ever serve as a bond of union among those who
remain!</p>

had the unenviable task of carting rations from battalion headquarters
to the kitchen in the line. On this hazardous trip
"Pinky" had to follow the road from Mandres to Beaumont

One night the military police stationed at Mandres stopped him
and said: "They're shelling the curve every few minutes, you
better be careful."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
